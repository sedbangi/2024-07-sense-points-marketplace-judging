# Incorrect Assumption of Reward Token Decimals

## Summary
Assuming the reward token has 18 decimals without verifying the actual number of decimals can lead to incorrect reward calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `RedemptionParams` struct, the `rewardsPerPToken` variable assumes that the reward token has 18 decimals. If the reward token has a different number of decimals (e.g., 6 or 8), this assumption can cause severe miscalculations, either over-rewarding or under-rewarding users. This issue can lead to significant financial losses, particularly in scenarios involving tokens with fewer decimals, where the impact of the incorrect assumption is magnified.

## Impact
The incorrect assumption about the reward tokenâ€™s decimals can lead to significant financial losses:

* Over-rewarding: If the reward token has fewer than 18 decimals (e.g., 6 decimals), users will receive exponentially more tokens than intended. This could drain the contract's reserves or cause inflation in the token's supply.
* Under-rewarding: If the reward token has more than 18 decimals, users will receive far fewer tokens than expected, leading to dissatisfaction and potential legal issues.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L61-L65

```solidity
    struct RedemptionParams {
        ERC20 rewardToken;
        uint256 rewardsPerPToken; // Assume 18 decimals.
        bool isMerkleBased;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, the calculation of rewards should be adjusted based on the actual number of decimals of the reward token. Below is an example of how the code can be modified:

```solidity
function calculateRewards(uint256 pTokensAmount, RedemptionParams memory params) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 tokenDecimals = params.rewardToken.decimals();
    uint256 rewardsPerPTokenAdjusted = params.rewardsPerPToken / (10 ** (18 - tokenDecimals));
    return pTokensAmount * rewardsPerPTokenAdjusted;
}
```
This approach dynamically adjusts the reward calculations based on the actual decimals of the reward token, ensuring accurate and fair distribution of rewards.
