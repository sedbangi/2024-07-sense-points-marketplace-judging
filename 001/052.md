# Improper Receiver Verification Allowing Misrouted PToken Claims

### Summary

The `PointTokenVault` allows users to designate trusted addresses that can claim these tokens on their behalf. However, the design of this mechanism is vulnerable to a frontrunning attack that could lead to misdirected tokens.

Specifically, the contract does not adequately verify the intended recipient during the claim process, allowing any trusted address to claim any type of PToken for a user. This oversight enables a bad actor to intercept and frontrun a legitimate claim transaction, redirecting the tokens to an unintended trusted address. Such an exploit could result in tokens being sent to addresses that are not capable of handling or managing them, potentially causing loss or mismanagement of assets.

### Root Cause

Generalized Trust without Specificity:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L164C5-L167C6

```solidity
function trustClaimer(address _account, bool _isTrusted) public {
        trustedClaimers[msg.sender][_account] = _isTrusted;
        emit TrustClaimer(msg.sender, _account, _isTrusted);
    }

```

The trustClaimer function allows users to trust multiple addresses to claim tokens on their behalf. However, this trust is not specific to any particular type of PToken or pointsId.


Proof Verification without Receiver Consideration:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L145C9-L146C83

```solidity
bytes32 claimHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_account, pointsId, _claim.totalClaimable));
        _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(_claim, claimHash, _account, claimedPTokens);

```

The _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed function verifies the claim based on a hashed combination of the user account, pointsId, and the total claimable amount. It does not incorporate the receiver address in the verification process.

Insufficient Receiver Validation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L152C9-L154C10

```solidity
if (_account != _receiver && !trustedClaimers[_account][_receiver]) {
            revert NotTrustedClaimer();
        }

```

In the claimPTokens function, the contract checks if the receiver is trusted by the user but does not ensure that the receiver is the intended specific recipient for that particular PToken type.

Since the claim process does not bind the verified proof specifically to the intended recipient, a malicious actor can observe claim transactions on the network, duplicate the proof, and front-run the legitimate user’s transaction by substituting the receiver with an unintended yet trusted address.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user must have set more than one address as a trusted claimer using the trustClaimer function.

The user must be eligible to claim rewards for multiple types of PTokens, each associated with a different pointsId.

### External pre-conditions

Ownership of Trusted Addresses:

The trusted addresses set by the user for claiming PTokens are not solely controlled by the user. This means that the trusted addresses belong to different parties or contracts, and not just the user.


Intent Specific to PToken Types:

Different trusted addresses are specifically designated for processing different types of PTokens. Each trusted address is intended to handle a particular type of PToken due to distinct processing logic or requirements.

### Attack Path

Monitoring the Network:

A bad actor monitors the network for claimPTokens transactions, specifically looking for transactions involving users who have multiple trusted addresses.

Identifying a Target Transaction:

The attacker identifies a target transaction where the user is claiming PTokens. The transaction includes the Claim struct with the proof but has not yet been mined.

Copying the Proof:

The attacker copies the Merkle proof and other relevant details from the pending transaction’s calldata.

Front-Running the Transaction:

The attacker quickly crafts a new transaction using the copied proof and submits it to the network with a higher gas price, intending to get it mined before the original transaction.

Misusing Trusted Addresses:

In the crafted transaction, the attacker substitutes the original intended receiver address with a different trusted address that is also recognized by the contract for the same user but is inappropriate for the specific PToken being claimed.


The front-run transaction gets mined first, and the PTokens are minted to the substituted trusted address that lacks the logic to handle the specific type of PToken.


### Impact

Loss of tokens if the trusted address cannot handle or manage the specific type of PToken.
Disruption of workflow or intended processes due to tokens being sent to addresses ill-equipped to process them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement additional mappings or logic to ensure that each trusted address is linked to specific PToken types. This ensures that a trusted address can only claim the PTokens it is intended to handle.

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) public trustedClaimersForToken; // user => pointsId => trusted

function trustClaimerForToken(address _account, bytes32 pointsId, bool _isTrusted) public {
    trustedClaimersForToken[msg.sender][pointsId] = _isTrusted;
    emit TrustClaimerForToken(msg.sender, _account, pointsId, _isTrusted);
}

```
