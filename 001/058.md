# A malicious user could use claimPTokens function to steal depositor's fund

## Summary
The provided smart contract code allows users to claim pTokens and trust other addresses to claim on their behalf. However, a critical vulnerability exists in the interaction between the claimPTokens and trustClaimer functions, which can be exploited by a malicious actor to steal tokens from unsuspecting users.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor (hacker) could trick a user (Bob) into calling the trustClaimer function to add the hacker's address as a trusted claimer.
Once Bob has marked the hacker as a trusted claimer, the hacker could call claimPTokens on behalf of Bob, directing the claimed pTokens to an address they control (_receiver).
The hacker could steal all the pTokens that Bob is entitled to claim, minus the mint fee, effectively draining Bobâ€™s funds.

## Impact
This could lead to a complete loss of funds for any user who is tricked into adding a malicious actor as a trusted claimer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before executing claimPTokens on behalf of another user, require explicit confirmation from the user (e.g., an off-chain signature) that they authorize the specific claim transaction. This would add an extra step, making it harder for hackers to exploit.
Modify the claimPTokens function to require an explicit approval from the user before the trusted claimer can execute the claim
```solidity
function claimPTokens(Claim calldata _claim, address _account, address _receiver) public {
    bytes32 pointsId = _claim.pointsId;

+    // Require explicit user approval for this specific claim
+    require(claimApprovals[_account][msg.sender][_claim.pointsId], "Claim not approved by user");
    ...
}
```
