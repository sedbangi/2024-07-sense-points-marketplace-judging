# Redeeming rewards in portions will result in user receiving less rewards

## Summary
Since the pTokens are burned according to the calculated pTokensToBurn, the user ends up burning more tokens overall when claiming in portions, leading to a situation where they effectively receive less in rewards than they would have if they had claimed the full amount in a single transaction..

## Vulnerability Detail
Users pass `_claim` struct to the `redeemRewards` . `totalClaimable` holds how much user can claim and `amountToClaim` holds how much will be claimed in the current transaction. `pTokens` are burned according to the calculated `pTokensToBurn` by dividing `amountToClaim` to `rewardsPerPToken`.

```jsx
uint256 pTokensToBurn = FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken);
```
Here, divWadUp is a function that performs division and rounds up the result.
Example with numbers:
1. Single claim 100 tokens at once :
 - pTokensToBurn = divWadUp(100, 1.5) = 67
 
  total pTokens burned = 67
 
 2. Multiple Claims 10 x 10 tokens  :
- 1st time pTokensToBurn = divWadUp(10, 1.5) = 7
- ...
- 9th time pTokensToBurn = divWadUp(10, 1.5) = 7
- 10th time pTokensToBurn = divWadUp(10, 1.5) = 7

The math is: 

total pTokens burned = 10 x 7 = 70

## Recommendation
Make the users to claim in a single transaction or adjust the pTokensToBurn calculation to account for the total claimable amount across multiple transactions.
