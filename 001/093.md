# Protocol overcharges fees in `redeemRewards` function

## Summary
The `redeemRewards` function has a logic flaw in the fee calculation when redeeming rewards leading to overcharging fees in certain scenarios where the feelessly redeemable tokens are less than the tokens to be burned.

## Vulnerability Detail
Take a look at  the `redeemRewards` function when [calculating](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L198-L221) the fee for redeeming point tokens (pTokens) for rewards. Specifically, when the feelessly redeemable tokens (`feelesslyRedeemable`) are less than the tokens to be burned (`pTokensToBurn`), the function calculates the fee based on the entire `redeemableWithFee` amount. This results in overcharging fees because it does not properly account for the portion of tokens that should still be feeless.

### POC
Lets assume:
- `claimed = 1000` pTokens
- `feelesslyRedeemed = 800` pTokens
- `pTokensToBurn = 300` pTokens
- `rewardsPerPToken = 1` reward per pToken
- `redemptionFee = 0.1` (10%)

In this case:
- `feelesslyRedeemable = claimed - feelesslyRedeemed = 1000 - 800 = 200` pTokens
- `redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn - feelesslyRedeemable = 300 - 200 = 100` pTokens

The protocol calculates the fee as:
```solidity
fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
    FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(100, 1), 0.1
) = 10 rewards
```

This implies that the user is charged a fee of 10 rewards for redeeming 100 pTokens, even though 200 pTokens should be feeless.

## Impact
The incorrect fee calculation can lead to users being overcharged when redeeming their pTokens for rewards. Results in loss of rewards for the users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Its recommended to adjust the fee calculation to only apply to the portion of tokens that exceed the feeless amount. 

```diff
if (feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn) {
    // If all of the pTokens are free to redeem without fee.
    rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim;
    feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += pTokensToBurn;
} else {
    // If some or all of the pTokens need to be charged a fee.
    uint256 redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn - feelesslyRedeemable;
-   fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
-                FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken), redemptionFee
+   uint256 rewardsWithFee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken);
+   fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(rewardsWithFee, redemptionFee);

    rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += fee;
    rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim - fee;

-   if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
-       feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
-   }
+   feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
}
```
