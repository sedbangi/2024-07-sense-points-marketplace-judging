# If a user claims to a trusted claimer, he will have to pay more fees

### Summary

The [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function allows users to claim their pTokens, and mint them to a specific address. The protocol implements a so called "fee on the borders" strategy, via the readme: *We chose a "fee on the borders" strategy in the vault where users are only charged for redemption if they redeem in excess of what they minted, pToken wise.* However if the **_receiver** parameter is different than the **_account**, the **_receiver** will be minted the pTokens, pay a minting fee, and when the receiver tries to redeem his pTokens via the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function he will have to pay a redeeming fee as well. The [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function internally calls the the [_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L271-L296) function where the  **claimedPTokens** mapping is updated for the **_account** parameter provided in the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function, not the **_receiver** . The  **claimedPTokens** mapping is used in 
the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function to determine how much pTokens a user can redeem without paying a redeeming fee. If the pTokens are merkle based the **_receiver** won't be able to directly claim the tokens as well, as he won't have the so called redemption rights, which are checked on the following line in the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function:
```solidity
        if (isMerkleBased) {
            // If it's merkle-based, only those callers with redemption rights can redeem their point token for rewards.

            bytes32 claimHash =
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(REDEMPTION_RIGHTS_PREFIX, msg.sender, pointsId, _claim.totalClaimable));
            _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(_claim, claimHash, msg.sender, claimedRedemptionRights);
        }
```
Keep in mind that the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function is permissionless, and everybody can call it and set the **_account** and **_receiver** parameters, if the owner of **_account** has approved the **_receiver** via the [trustClaimer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L164-L167) function. The approval is for all pTokens not just one, if for some reason the owner of the **_account** address has set the **_receiver** address as a trustedClaimer, intending to use it to claim pTokenA, but the owner of **_account** can also claim pTokens B which are merkle based, another user can call the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function for pTokens B and claim them to the **_receiver** address.
### Root Cause

In the [_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L271-L296) function which is internally called by the the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function **claimedPTokens** mapping is updated for the **_account** parameter provided in the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function, not the **_receiver** .

### Internal pre-conditions
1. User A calls the [trustClaimer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L164-L167) function and sets User B as a trusted claimer.
2. User A calls the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function in order to claim all of his pTokens and provides the address of User A as the **_account** parameter, and the address of User B as the **_receiver** parameter.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If a user sets another account that can receive his pTokens in the **trustedClaimers** mapping, and claims his pTokens to that account, the trusted claimer account will have to pay an addition redeeming fee, leading to a loss of rewards for the user. If pTokens are merkle based, the trusted claimer won't be able to redeem his rewards via the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function.

### Mitigation
Use the **_receiver** parameter provided in the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function to update the laimedPTokens** mapping in the  [_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L271-L296) function. Implement a way to check if the pTokens are merkle based,  and if so don't allow users to set the **_receiver** parameter to a different address than the **_account** parameter.
