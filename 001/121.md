# User will receive less or more token if reward token decimal is not 18

### Summary

When a user calls `convertRewardsToPTokens` to convert reward tokens into `pToken`, the amount to be converted is not adjusted to the `pToken` decimals if the reward token does not have 18 decimals. This results in the wrong value being minted to the user.


### Root Cause

The token amount provided by the user is not converted to 18 decimals and is directly used as provided. This will result in incorrect calculations if the reward token does not have 18 decimals.

### Internal pre-conditions

The reward token is supported by `PTokenVault`.


### External pre-conditions

The reward token decimals are not 18.


### Attack Path

1. The Vault supports USDC as a reward token.
2. The user has `USDC = 1e6` and wants to convert it into `pToken`.
3. The `rewardsPerPToken` for USDC is `1e18`.
4. The user calls `convertRewardsToPTokens` with `_amountToConvert = 1e6`.
5. Due to not converting the USDC value into 18 decimals, the user will receive `pToken = 1,000,000`.
6. The user should have received `pToken = 1e18`.


### Impact

The user will receive fewer tokens if the reward token decimals are less than 18. Conversely, if the reward token decimals are more than 18, the user will receive more tokens.

### Mitigation

Convert the given amount into 18 decimals first before calculating how many `pTokens` will be minted. Part of the recommendation to fix this issue has already been reported in my other report. Here, I will focus only on converting value decimals.
