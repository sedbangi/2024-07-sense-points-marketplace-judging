# Anyone can distribute users ptokens to trusted claimers with wrong intended amounts due to missing access control

## Summary
For users with more than one trusted claimer e.g. protocols, can get their point tokens distributed by anyone to their trusted claimers with unintended proportions due to missing access control.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users or protocols can claim their point tokens after verifying the Merkle proof, this claimable point tokens can be minted to either themselves or to addresses they add as trusted claimers: 
```solidity
    function claimPTokens(Claim calldata _claim, address _account, address _receiver) public {
        bytes32 pointsId = _claim.pointsId;

@>      bytes32 claimHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_account, pointsId, _claim.totalClaimable));
        _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(_claim, claimHash, _account, claimedPTokens);
```
However, note from the above that the verifying although updates the amount claimed, verifies only the account and totalclaimable but doesn't verify the amount to claim for the specified receiver. The issue here is that this `claimPTokens()` function has no access control and can be called by anyone for any user. This means if called by anyone else for users with more than one trusted claimer can get their point tokens distributed to the trusted claimers with the wrong intended amounts.

Let's consider this scenario
- A protocol integrating rumpel vault whitelists a set of users(Alice and Bob) setting them as trusted claimers
- Their allocations for the whitelist program were 80% to Alice and 40% to Bob
- verifying the Merkle proof, attackers sees protocol transactions to `claimPTokens()` and frontruns it sending 100% to Bob
- Protocol loses entire amount meant for alice to bob due to missing access control

## Impact
Owners can get their point tokens distributed to trusted claimers with the wrong intended amounts due to missing access control.

## Recommendation
Require _account == msg.sender, or consider adding an amountToclaim variable to the trustedClaimers mapping which will be checked allowing owners to specify the amount to claim for each trustedClaimer.
