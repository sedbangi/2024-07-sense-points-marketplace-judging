# Inflated Fees Due to Inaccurate Rounding in Fee Calculations

### Summary

Inaccurate rounding during fee calculations can lead to inflated fees when redeeming point tokens, unfairly overcharging users. Rounding up at multiple stages may result in users receiving fewer rewards than expected and cause the system to collect more fees than intended.

### Root Cause

In the redeemRewards function, rounding errors occur because rounding up is used three times for fee calculations:
once for pTokensToBurn:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L191
and twice for the calculation of the fees): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L211-L212
The variable fee rounds up at each step. This repeated rounding up can result in an overestimated fee. To address this, we should use mulWadDown in the first fee calculation instead of mulWadUp. This change will ensure that rounding is minimized and occurs only once, thus reducing the total rounding error and leading to a more accurate fee calculation.



### Internal pre-conditions

-Whenever the function redeemReward() is called:
-  feelesslyRedeemable should be less than pTokensToBurn
If at least two of these three conditions are met:
- While calculating pTokensToBurn, division of amountToClaim by rewardPerPToken has a remainder
- While calculating the fee variable, the product of redeemableWithFee and rewardsPerPToken is not an integer
- The product of redeemableWithFee and rewardsPerPToken multiplied by redemptionFee is not an integer

### Attack Path

1. User Submits Claim: The user submits a claim that includes an amount of point tokens to redeem, which triggers the redeemRewards function.
2. Points to Burn Calculated: The function calculates the number of point tokens to burn (pTokensToBurn), applying rounding up which may overestimate the amount.
3. Fee Calculation: The function computes the fee using rounded values for pTokensToBurn and rewardsPerPToken, which involves multiple rounding operations.
4. Impact on Rewards: The fee calculated might be higher than intended due to rounding, leading to a reduction in the rewards transferred to the user and an increase in the collected fees.

### Impact

The excessive rounding in fee calculations can lead to users receiving fewer rewards than anticipated, as overestimated fees reduce the net amount of rewards they receive. Users will be charged unfairly. Additionally, the reward distribution system may collect more in fees than intended, causing financial imbalances and distorting the reward distribution mechanism. Over time, this could undermine trust in the contract's accuracy and fairness, potentially affecting the overall integrity and reliability of the reward system.

### Mitigation

To address the excessive rounding issue, modify the fee calculation in the redeemRewards function by using mulWadDown instead of mulWadUp for the first multiplication operation involving redeemableWithFee. This change will ensure that rounding errors are minimized by rounding down during the initial fee calculation, thereby limiting the total rounding effect and leading to a more accurate and fair calculation of the fee. This approach helps in maintaining precision and preventing users from receiving fewer rewards than intended.
