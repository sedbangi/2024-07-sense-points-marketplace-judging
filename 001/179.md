# feelesslyRedeemedPTokens mapping is not properly updated in redeemRewards function on PointTokenVault

## Summary

`feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` mapping is not properly updated in `redeemRewards` function on `PointTokenVault.sol` contract when `feelesslyRedeemed != claimed`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Instead of adding to the overall `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]`, the code just equals the `claimed` value to the mapping which causes incorrect amount of `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` to be stored on the mapping.

## Impact

Bug causes incorrect claim amounts to be open to manipulation by user. This can benefit him during multiple claiming events.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rewrite the line as following:
```solidity
if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
    feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += claimed;
}
```
