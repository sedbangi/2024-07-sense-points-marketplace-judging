# Users will not be able to redeem their entire balance of PTokens

## Summary
The use of FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken) for calculating pTokensToBurn means that the division rounds up. This can result in a scenario where the calculated number of PTokens to burn is slightly higher than what would be required if the division were exact.

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the implementation of the redeem function, users might need to have more PTokens than the exact amount needed for the redemption due to the rounding up. This can prevent users from redeeming their entire balance if they have just enough PTokens for an exact redemption.

```solidity
uint256 pTokensToBurn = FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken);
        pTokens[pointsId].burn(msg.sender, pTokensToBurn);
```

## Impact
Redemption of complete PToken balance is impossible as some will always be stuck in contract and this increases per redemption and reduces user experience

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a rounding down approach for the division to ensure users can redeem their entire balance or Implement a mechanism to handle or redeem small residual balances (dust) that might otherwise be left unredeemed.
