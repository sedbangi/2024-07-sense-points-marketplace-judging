# Attacker can frontrun another account and call `claimPTokens()` , if an account give `trustClaimer()` to multiple accounts

### Summary

In `PointTokenVault.sol` if a person gives `trustClaim` to multiple people for claming PTokens. one of the users in those claimers can able to frontrun and claim faster than them.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162

In the above function, there is a possibility for the frontrunning attack in the `claimPTokens()`. Due to which if there are multiple trusted claimers for a particular account. One of the trusted claimers of the account will frontrun another trusted claimers transactions to claim faster than first person.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice will deposit points earning tokens into the `PointTokenVault.sol` contract
2. Alice will call `trustClaimer()` by passing Bob and Charlie addresses with `true`
3. Bob will try to call `claimPTokens()` on behalf of Alice
4. Charlie sees Bobs transaction and will try to frontrun Bob's transaction to claim the tokens faster than Bob.
5. Charlie will successfully able to claim pTokens on behalf of Alice
6. Bobs transaction will fail as the tokens were already claimed by Charlie.

### Impact

Due to this frontrunning attack one of the claimers will get frontrunned by another claimer and he will eventually loose tokens which he wanted to claim first.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue we have to create another variable `userClaimStatuses` mapping and update the mapping values in the `claimPTokens()` function.

```solidity
// introducing new stroage variable to check userClaimStatuses
mapping (address user => bool status ) userClaimStatuses;

function claimPTokens(Claim calldata _claim, address _account, address _receiver) public {
+       if (userClaimStatuses[_account]){
+               revert alreadyOneOfTheClaimerIsClaiming();
+       }
+       userClaimStatuses[_account] = true;
        bytes32 pointsId = _claim.pointsId;

        bytes32 claimHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_account, pointsId, _claim.totalClaimable));
        _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(_claim, claimHash, _account, claimedPTokens);

        if (address(pTokens[pointsId]) == address(0)) {
            revert PTokenNotDeployed();
        }

        if (_account != _receiver && !trustedClaimers[_account][_receiver]) {
            revert NotTrustedClaimer();
        }

        uint256 pTokenFee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(_claim.amountToClaim, mintFee);
        pTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += pTokenFee;

        pTokens[pointsId].mint(_receiver, _claim.amountToClaim - pTokenFee); // Subtract mint fee.

        emit PTokensClaimed(_account, _receiver, pointsId, _claim.amountToClaim, pTokenFee);
+       userClaimStatuses[_account] = false;
    }
```
