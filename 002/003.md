# Lack of support on fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Summary
Due to `README.md`, the protocol should support fee-on-transfer tokens.
However, `PointTokenVault.deposit()` function doesn't support fee-on-transfer tokens.
It may cause protocol insolvency.

## Vulnerability Detail
`PointTokenVault.deposit()` function is following.
```solidity
    function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }

123:    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

125:    balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```
As can be seen, the function transfers `_amount` of tokens on `L123` and increases balance by `_amount` on `L125`.
However, if `_token` is fee-on-transfer token, the transferred amount of `_token` may be less than `_amount`.

Example:
1. Assume that `_token` is fee-on-transfer token and transfer fee is `1%`.
2. If `user1` deposit `100` tokens, only `99` tokens will be transferred to the vault, however the balance of `user1` will be recorded as `100`.
3. If `user2` deposit `100` tokens, only `99` tokens will be transferred to the vault, however the balance of `user2` will be recorded as `100`.
4. Then the total balance of the vault is `198`.
5. If `user1` withdraw `100`, the balance of the vault will be `198 - 100 = 98`.
6. If `user2` tries to withdraw `100`, it will be reverted because `100` is larger than the balance of the vault. It means protocol insolvency.

## Impact
This issue causes protocol insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `PointTokenVault.deposit()` function as follows.
```solidity
    function auctionEnd() external {
    function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }

++      uint256 oldBalance = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

--      balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;
++      balances[_receiver][_token] += (_token.balanceOf(address(this)) - oldBalance);

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```
