# Fee on transfer tokens will create insolvency in `PointTokenVault.sol`

## Summary
In the readMe it is stated that fee on transfer tokens will be supported. However due to wrong accounting they will likely create insolvency.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls deposit, the balance that the contract will actually have will be less than what is being set in `balances`. As a result if everybody calls withdraw the assets will not be enough to satisfy everyone's withdraw.
## Impact
Protocol insolvency - High

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track the balance before and after the transfer in the deposit function and calculate the balance delta in order to account for the fees.
