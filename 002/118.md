# Unset deposit cap will prevent users from depositing tokens

### Summary

The use of an uninitialized deposit cap will cause a failure in token deposits for users as the contract blocks deposits when no cap is explicitly set.

### Root Cause

In [PointTokenVault.sol:114-128](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L114-L128), the deposit function checks the deposit cap using the caps mapping. If the cap has not been set, it defaults to 0, which causes the deposit to fail unless a cap has been explicitly initialized.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `OPERATOR_ROLE` no needs to call setCap() at all, they forget to do this

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user attempts to deposit a token where the deposit cap has not been explicitly set.
2. The contract checks the cap, which defaults to 0 (interpreted as a maximum deposit of 0 tokens).
3. The deposit reverts due to the DepositExceedsCap error.

### Impact

The users cannot deposit tokens if the deposit cap is not explicitly set, which disrupts the contractâ€™s usability and prevents users from adding funds to the vault.

### PoC

No code is necessary for this proof of concept, as the issue arises from the default behavior when the cap is unset. Simply attempting a deposit without setting the cap first will trigger the issue.

### Mitigation

Modify the deposit function to treat an uninitialized cap as type(uint256).max, effectively allowing unlimited deposits unless a specific cap is set:
```solidity
function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
    uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

    if (cap == 0) {
        cap = type(uint256).max;  // Treat uninitialized caps as unlimited.
    }

    if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
        revert DepositExceedsCap();
    }

    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

    balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
}
```
This adjustment ensures users can deposit tokens even if the cap has not been explicitly set.
