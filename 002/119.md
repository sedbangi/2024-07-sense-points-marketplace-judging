# Fee-on-Transfer Tokens will Cause Accounting Discrepancies for Users

### Summary

From README:
> Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
> Yes, whitelisted tokens only. They're assumed to not be reentrant, but **fee-on-transfer, pausable, and blocklist tokens are OK**.

But the current implementation of the `PointTokenVault` contract does not account for fee-on-transfer tokens, which will cause accounting discrepancies for users as the contract will incorrectly record the amount of tokens deposited or withdrawn.


### Root Cause

In `PointTokenVault.sol`, the contract does not account for fee-on-transfer tokens in the [`deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L114-L128) and [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L130-L136) functions. This leads to incorrect balances being recorded.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must allow fee-on-transfer tokens to be deposited or withdrawn.

### External pre-conditions

1. A fee-on-transfer token must be used with the `PointTokenVault` contract.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits a fee-on-transfer token into the `PointTokenVault` contract.
2. The contract records the full amount of tokens as deposited, not accounting for the fee deducted.
3. User withdraws tokens from the contract.
4. The contract attempts to transfer the full amount of tokens, but the user receives less due to the fee deducted.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of tokens due to the fee deducted during transfers, leading to incorrect balances and potential loss of funds.

### PoC

1. User deposits 100 fee-on-transfer tokens with a 1% fee into the `PointTokenVault` contract.
2. The contract records 100 tokens as deposited, but only 99 tokens are actually received.
3. User withdraws 100 tokens from the contract.
4. The contract attempts to transfer 100 tokens, but the user only receives 99 tokens due to the fee.

### Mitigation

Implement checks and balances to account for potential fees in the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions.
