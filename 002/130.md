# Lack of Support for Fee-on-Transfer Tokens in PointTokenVault.sol Leads to Potential User Fund Loss

## Summary
The system does not support fee-on-transfer tokens, leading to potential loss of funds for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the readme it states that fee-on-transfer tokens are in scope but it is not supported by the system. The PointTokenVault.sol contract allows users to deposit and withdraw funds from the vault. However, when using fee-on-transfer tokens, the vault receives fewer tokens than expected due to the fee deducted during the transfer. The system incorrectly updates the `balances` state variable, leading to a situation where users cannot withdraw the full amount of their funds because of less tokens present in the vault, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Impact
Potential loss of user funds due to incorrect handling of fee-on-transfer tokens.
