# Reward tokens that were not claimed would be stuck in the vault forever

## Summary

In the current implementation of `PointTokenVault`, users are able to redeem reward tokens that were sent from external protocol by burning their pTokens. The problem lies in the function `_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()` that checks for the root and that may disallow users to claim reward tokens if it was a late claim.

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at `redeemRewards()` functionality:

https://github.com/sense-finance/point-tokenization-vault/blob/dev/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L183-189
```solidity
 if (isMerkleBased) {
            // If it's merkle-based, only those callers with redemption rights can redeem their point token for rewards.

            bytes32 claimHash =
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(REDEMPTION_RIGHTS_PREFIX, msg.sender, pointsId, _claim.totalClaimable));
            _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(_claim, claimHash, msg.sender, claimedRedemptionRights);
        }

```

As you can see, if the redemption is merkle based, the internal function `_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()` will be called. Inside of it, there is a check to determine if the `candidateRoot` corresponds either to `currRoot` or `prevRoot`. If it does not correspond, the function will just revert meaning the user will not be able to claim his rewards:

https://github.com/sense-finance/point-tokenization-vault/blob/dev/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L282-284
```solidity
 if (candidateRoot != currRoot && candidateRoot != prevRoot) {
            revert ProofInvalidOrExpired();
        }
```

## Impact

This creates a situation where rewards from external protocol were sent to the vault but were not claimed if the claim was expired meaning the tokens would just get stuck in the vault. There is also no function to withdraw such tokens.

## Recommendation

Allow users to get rewards from any root or create a `withdrawERC20()` alike function to withdraw reward tokens.
