# There's no upper bound check on the `_mintFee` parameter

### Summary


in the `setMintFee` function in the `PointTokenVault` contract,

```solidity
function setMintFee(uint256 _mintFee) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    mintFee = _mintFee;
    emit MintFeeSet(_mintFee);
}
```

The bug in this function is related to a critical missed check

There's no upper bound check on the `_mintFee` parameter

This is problematic because:

- An operator could potentially set the mint fee to 100% , which would effectively prevent users from minting any PTokens, as all minted tokens would be taken as fees.


### Impact and PoC:

severely disrupts the intended functionality of the system. Users would be unable to claim their earned points, breaking the core value proposition of the platform.as it would mean users receive no pTokens when claiming


1. It undermines the trust in the system. Users expect to receive pTokens proportional to their earned points, minus a reasonable fee.
2. It could be used to manipulate the token supply or completely halt token distribution.
3. It gives excessive power to the OPERATOR_ROLE, which goes against the principle of decentralization

### Method

Manual review

### Mitigation 

To fix this, the function should include a check to ensure that the mint fee doesn't exceed a reasonable maximum
