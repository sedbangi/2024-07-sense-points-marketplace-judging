# Lack of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` Assignment will Restrict Role Management for Deployer

### Summary

The absence of explicit assignment of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` in the constructor will cause an inability to manage roles for the deployer as no address will have the necessary permissions to grant or revoke roles.

### Root Cause

In [`PToken.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PToken.sol#L13-L19), the constructor does not assign `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to any address.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Deployer needs to deploy the `PToken` contract.
2. Deployer needs to attempt to grant or revoke roles using `grantRole` or `revokeRole`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Deployer deploys the `PToken` contract.
2. Deployer attempts to grant `PAUSE_ROLE` or `SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE` to a new address using `grantRole`.
3. The operation fails because no address has the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

### Impact

The deployer cannot manage roles, making the contract inflexible and potentially unusable if key roles need to be updated.


### PoC

1. Deploy the `PToken` contract:
    ```solidity
    PToken token = new PToken("Test", "TST", 18);
    ```
2. Attempt to grant `PAUSE_ROLE` to a new address:
    ```solidity
    address newAdmin = address(0x123);
    token.grantRole(token.PAUSE_ROLE(), newAdmin);
    ```
3. The operation will revert because `msg.sender` does not have `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.


### Mitigation

Explicitly grant the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the deployer in the constructor. Hereâ€™s the fix:

```diff
 constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint8 _decimals)
     ERC20(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
     AccessControl()
 {
+    _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender); // Grant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to deployer
     _grantRole(PAUSE_ROLE, msg.sender);
     _grantRole(SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
 }
```
