# [M-1] Solmate's safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions do not validate the code size of the token address. This oversight could result in a loss of funds if the address is not a valid contract.

**Impact**

the safetransfer and safetransferfrom don't check the existence of code at the token address. This is a known issue while using solmate's libraries. Hence this may lead to miscalculation of funds and may lead to loss of funds, because if safetransfer() and safetransferfrom() are called on a token address that doesn't have a contract in it, it will always return success, bypassing the return value check. Due to this protocol will think that funds have been transferred successfully, and records will be accordingly calculated, but in reality, funds were never transferred. So this will lead to miscalculation and possibly loss of funds

**Tools Used**

Manual Review


**Recommended mitigation**

Use openzeppelin's safeERC20 or implement a code existence check
