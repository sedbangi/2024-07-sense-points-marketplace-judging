# Lack of slippage protection on claim, redeem and convert function on `PointTokenVault` contracts, this may cause user get the number of tokens not as expected

### Summary

The three main functions in the `PointTokenVault` contract such as `claimPTokens()`, `redeemRewards()` and `convertRewardsToPTokens()` do not have slippage protection. While the three functions have two other variables that can cause slippage issues / users do not receive the number of tokens as expected. The two variables are `fee` and `rewardsPerToken`. Although both variables are set by the admin, the user still cannot set the minimum limit whether the value of the `claim` / `redeem` / `convert` token is as desired.

### Root Cause

1. In [PointTokenVault::claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) there is no slippage protection 
2. In [PointTokenVault::redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) there is no slippage protection
3. In [PointTokenVault::convertRewardsToPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L229-L254) there is no slippage protection
