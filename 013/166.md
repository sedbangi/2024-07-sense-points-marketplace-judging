# Front-running Vulnerability in PToken Deployment Due to Predictable Deterministic Addressing

# Summary

The `PointTokenVault` contract's `deployPToken` function uses `CREATE2` with a predictable salt (pointsId), allowing front-running attacks. An attacker can observe the mempool for pending deployment transactions, predict the PToken address, and deploy a malicious contract to that address before the legitimate deployment occurs.

# Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability exists in the [`deployPToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L256-L268) function of the `PointTokenVault` contract. 

The issue arises from:

1. The public visibility of the function, allowing anyone to call it.
2. The use of `_pointsId` as the salt for `CREATE2`, which is predictable if an attacker can observe the admin's transactions in the mempool.
3. The lack of additional randomness or access control in the deployment process.

The `_pointsId` is created using the `LibString.packTwo` function. An attacker can observe a pending transaction in the mempool that includes the `_pointsId`, predict the address where the PToken will be deployed, and front-run the transaction to deploy a malicious contract at that address.

# Impact

- Deployment of malicious PToken contracts that mimic legitimate ones but contain hidden malicious functionality.
- This vulnerability could lead to financial losses, compromise the integrity of the point tokenization system, and potentially cause reputational damage to the protocol.

# Tool used

Manual Review

# Recommendation

- Use a factory contract pattern:
    - Create a dedicated factory contract for PToken deployment.
    - Implement additional checks and access controls in the factory.
- Enhance the salt used in CREATE2:
    - Include additional unpredictable data in the salt.
- Restrict access to the deployPToken function:
    - Make the function only callable by trusted addresses or a timelock contract.
