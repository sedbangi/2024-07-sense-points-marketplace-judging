# Renouncing PAUSE_ROLE Prevents PToken Functions from Being Paused If An Exploit Occurs Due to Irreversible Action

## Summary

The [PointTokenVault::renouncePauseRole()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L339C4-L341C6) function allows the operator to renounce the `PAUSE_ROLE` of a PToken linked to a specific points ID, but once renounced, the `PAUSE_ROLE` cannot be reassigned. This creates a critical vulnerability, as it prevents pausing the PToken's functions during an exploit, potentially allowing malicious activities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [PointTokenVault::renouncePauseRole()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L339C4-L341C6) function allows the `OPERATOR_ROLE` to renounce the `PAUSE_ROLE` of a PToken associated with a specific `_pointsId`. The issue is that once the `PAUSE_ROLE` is renounced, there is no mechanism to reassign it. This means that if an exploit occurs, the PTokenâ€™s functions cannot be paused. This creates a critical vulnerability, as it prevents the pausing of the PToken's functions in the event of an exploit, potentially leading to malicious activities

## Impact

After renouncing the PAUSE_ROLE of a PToken, its functions cannot be paused in the event of an exploit, potentially leading to malicious activities.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function renouncePauseRole(bytes32 _pointsId) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
        pTokens[_pointsId].renounceRole(pTokens[_pointsId].PAUSE_ROLE(), address(this));
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, I recommend implementing a mechanism that allows the reassignment of the `PAUSE_ROLE` after it has been renounced.
