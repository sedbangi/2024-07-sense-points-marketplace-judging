# Operator Can Permanently Prevent Users from Claiming PTokens

## Summary
The `PointTokenVault` contract allows an operator with the `OPERATOR_ROLE` to pause PTokens and subsequently renounce the pause role. This action can effectively lock the `PToken` in a paused state indefinitely, preventing users from claiming or transferring their `PTokens`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PointTokenVault` contract provides functions for the operator to pause and unpause `PTokens`:

The issue arises because the operator can pause a `PToken` and then renounce the `PAUSE_ROLE`:
- Pause: The operator pauses the `PToken`, preventing any transfers or minting.
- Renounce: The operator renounces the `PAUSE_ROLE`, which means no one can unpause the `PToken` in the future.
Once the `PToken` is paused and the role renounced, users will be unable to claim their `PTokens`, resulting in a complete lockout of their funds.

## Impact
This issue allows an operator to permanently lock users' ability to claim or transfer `PTokens`, leading to potential loss of access to rewards or assets linked to the`PToken`.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function pausePToken(bytes32 _pointsId) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    pTokens[_pointsId].pause();
}

function unpausePToken(bytes32 _pointsId) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    pTokens[_pointsId].unpause();
}

function renouncePauseRole(bytes32 _pointsId) external onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) {
    pTokens[_pointsId].renounceRole(pTokens[_pointsId].PAUSE_ROLE(), address(this));
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Restrict Renouncing: Disallow the renouncePauseRole function, ensuring that the pause function can always be reversed.

2. Role Assignment: Assign the PAUSE_ROLE to a different role that has limited permissions, or to a multi-signature wallet requiring multiple parties to approve such an action.

3. Failsafe Mechanism: Implement a failsafe mechanism where the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE or another high-privilege role can reassign the PAUSE_ROLE if needed, ensuring that the contract can recover from accidental or malicious renouncements.
