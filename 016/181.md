# The admin can transfer the entire user's ETH balance

## Summary
The admin can transfer the entire user's ETH balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Rumpel Safe Module allows an admin to execute calls on behalf of the Safe. The contract implements assurance logic to prevent unwanted calls from admins, such as transferring a user's USDC balance or other tokens. For that purpose, some calls can be blocked by using the `addBlockedModuleCall` function.

```solidity
 function addBlockedModuleCall(address target, bytes4 functionSelector) external onlyOwner {
        blockedModuleCalls[target][functionSelector] = true;
        emit SetModuleCallBlocked(target, functionSelector);
    }
```

When the `exec` function is called, it checks if the call is blocked by retrieving the value from the `blockedModuleCalls` mapping for the `to` address and call` data`: `bool blockedCall = blockedModuleCalls[call.to][bytes4(call.data)];`.

Currently, it is not possible to prevent the making of a simple ETH transfer where the data length is zero, which opens the possibility for an admin to transfer the whole user's ETH balance. It is easy for the whole ETH balance to be transferred to a random address that is not blocked.

## Impact
The user's entire ETH balance can be transferred to a random address.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When `call.data` is zero, check if the ETH transfer is allowed, similar to how it is done in `RumpleGuard` contract.
