# Missing whenNotPaused modifier in user functions

## Summary

The deposit, withdraw, and claim functions lack the whenNotPaused modifier. This means that even when pToken is paused, these functions remain accessible. Users can still deposit assets, but they won't be able to get their pTokens back in return.

## Vulnerability Detail

The deposit, withdraw, and claim functions do not have this modifier, allowing users to continue interacting with these functions even when pTokens are paused. This could lead to a scenario where users deposit assets without being able to retrieve pTokens.
While PointToken is pausable, PointTokenVault is not pausable. 

## Impact

Users deposits assets without being able to receive or redeem pTokens during the pause state, which can lead to funds being locked in the contract without the ability to reclaim them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add whenNotPaused modifier to the deposit, withdraw, and claim and other user functions to ensure these actions are disabled when the contract is paused. That will prevent users from interacting with these functions during a pause and avoid any unintended consequences.
