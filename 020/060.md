# A malicious user could deploy numerous PTokens to affect contract's operation

## Summary
There are no restrictions on who can call this function, it may be vulnerable to abuse, where a malicious user could deploy numerous PTokens with different _pointsId values. This could potentially affect the contract’s operation, leading to issues such as excessive resource consumption, unexpected state changes, or even denial of service (DoS) attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function can be called by any user, allowing anyone to deploy a new PToken contract. This can lead to a situation where a malicious actor continuously calls deployPToken with different _pointsId values, flooding the contract with new PToken deployments.
For example, an attacker could write a script to automatically generate and deploy a large number of PTokens, filling the pTokens mapping and consuming resources. This could degrade the contract's performance or even cause certain operations to fail due to excessive gas costs.

## Impact
This could result in excessive gas usage, potential state bloat, and could also trigger unexpected side effects or DoS conditions if the contract relies on the pTokens mapping being kept at a reasonable size.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce access control mechanisms, such as the onlyOwner or onlyRole modifiers, to restrict who can deploy PTokens. This would prevent unauthorized users from deploying tokens and limit the deployment process to trusted parties.
Use OpenZeppelin’s Ownable or AccessControl libraries to enforce these restrictions.
