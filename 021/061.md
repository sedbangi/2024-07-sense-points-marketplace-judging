# User can call RumpleWalletFactory.createWallet() with a 100,000 initial calls, causing Out-of-gas reverts, DoS'ing the RumpleWalletFactory unusable

### Summary

InitializationScript:20 initialize function has an unbounded for loop by looping through the initCalls array that is an input to the function. This function is called by the Safe's Safe.sol smart contracts when RumpleWalletFactory.createWallet() is called (which is an external function used to create RumpelWallets). The user can input a large array of initCalls and cause Out-of-gas DoS Attack.

### Root Cause

In InitializationScript:20 initialize function, there is a unbounded for loop on an arbitrary input array initCalls

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls RumpleWalletFactory.createWallet with 100,000 initial calls in the initCalls input array.
2. RumpleWalletFactory creates a SafeProxy -> Safe -> Which calls the InitializationScript.initialize function with the unbounded for loop in it
3. Looping through this array with a length of a 100000, it reverts with a Out-of-Gas
4. User can repeatedly call RumpleWalletFactory.createWallet and cause a DoS, making the Rumpel Wallet Factory unusable by anyone.


### Impact

DoS on the RumpelWalletFactory.createWallet function, rendering it unusable

### PoC

Add this test to RumpelWallet.t.sol after setup and run command - 


```solidity
function test_CreateWalletWithHundredThousandCallsOnDeploy() public {
        address[] memory owners = new address[](1);
        owners[0] = address(alice);

        // Call reverts if the call isn't allowed by the guard
        InitializationScript.InitCall[] memory initCalls = new InitializationScript.InitCall[](100000);
        for(uint256 i=0;i<100000;i++) {
            initCalls[i] =
            InitializationScript.InitCall({to: address(counter), data: abi.encodeCall(Counter.addToCount, (1))});
        }
        
        vm.prank(admin);
        rumpelGuard.setCallAllowed(address(counter), Counter.addToCount.selector, RumpelGuard.AllowListState.ON);
        initCalls[0] =
            InitializationScript.InitCall({to: address(counter), data: abi.encodeCall(Counter.addToCount, (1))});
        rumpelWalletFactory.createWallet{ gas: 3000000000000000000 }(owners, 1, initCalls);

        assertEq(counter.count(), 100000);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add a limit on the number of initial calls that can be inputted when creating a Rumpel Wallet. Additionally, it is better practice to avoid unbounded for loops on arbitrary input lengths
