# Attacker Will Exploit Reentrancy Vulnerability to Drain Rewards from `PointTokenVault` Contract

### Summary

The missing reentrancy guard in `PointTokenVault.sol` will cause a complete loss of reward tokens for the `PointTokenVault` contract as an attacker will exploit the reentrancy vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `redeemRewards` function before the contract’s state is updated.

### Root Cause

In [PointTokenVault.sol:172](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L227) , there is a missing reentrancy guard in the `redeemRewards` function. The contract makes an external call to `rewardToken.safeTransfer` before updating its internal state, leaving it vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `PointTokenVault` contract must have a sufficient balance of `rewardToken` to allow multiple redemptions.
The `pTokens` balance of the attacker must be sufficient to initiate a `redeemRewards` call.

### External pre-conditions

The attacker controls an address with a positive balance of `pTokens ` and can call `redeemRewards` with valid claim data.
Gas prices are low enough to allow multiple reentrant calls in a single transaction.

### Attack Path

The attacker calls `redeemRewards` on the `PointTokenVault` contract with valid claim data.
The `redeemRewards` function executes and transfers reward tokens to the attacker.
Before the contract's state is updated, the attacker reenters the contract and triggers another call to r`edeemRewards`.
This process is repeated multiple times, draining the contract's `rewardToken` balance.

### Impact

The `PointTokenVault` contract suffers a complete loss of its `rewardToken` balance. The attacker gains all the reward tokens stored in the contract, effectively draining it of all funds intended for legitimate users

        IVault(vault).redeemRewards();

        rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, balance);
    }

        // Reenter the vault contract during the transfer
        if (rewardToken.balanceOf(vault) > 0) {
            IVault(vault).redeemRewards();
        }
    }
}

interface IVault {
    function redeemRewards() external;
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a reentrancy guard to the `redeemRewards `function by using the nonReentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard contract. Alternatively, ensure that the contract's state is updated before making any external calls.
Or Use CEI in `redeemRewards()` function to prevent reentrancy attack
