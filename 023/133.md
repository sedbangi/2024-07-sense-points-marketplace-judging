# Reentrancy Vulnerability in deposit Function Could Lead to Loss of Funds

### Summary

The deposit function in the PointTokenVault contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. This issue arises because the function allows external calls (such as transferring tokens) before updating the internal state. An attacker could exploit this to repeatedly call the deposit function in a recursive manner, leading to incorrect or inflated balances. This flaw can result in the loss of funds or incorrect token accounting, which directly impacts the protocol's financial integrity and user balances.

### Root Cause

The reentrancy vulnerability occurs because the deposit function allows an external call (via token transfer) to occur before the contract's state is securely updated. This oversight enables a malicious contract to recursively invoke the deposit function before the state (like user balances) is fully settled.

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The deposit function makes an external call to an untrusted contract (i.e., an ERC20 transferFrom call).
The contract's internal state is not fully updated before the external call is made.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker must have the ability to deposit tokens into the PointTokenVault contract.
The attacker has deployed a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls deposit again.
The external token contract (ERC20 or custom implementation) allows reentrancy or does not revert on repeated transfers within the same transaction.

### Attack Path

Attacker deploys a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls deposit on the PointTokenVault.
The malicious contract initiates a deposit into PointTokenVault with some tokens.
Before the deposit function can update the attacker’s balance, the external transferFrom call triggers, and the malicious contract’s fallback function is called.
Fallback function makes another call to deposit recursively, effectively bypassing the initial balance update.
The attacker can repeat this process multiple times within a single transaction, leading to an inflated balance in PointTokenVault without a corresponding amount of deposited tokens.

### Impact

Inflated Balances: The attacker can artificially inflate their balance within the PointTokenVault without actually depositing the corresponding tokens. This results in the attacker having more tokens than they should.
Financial Loss: The protocol could face financial loss if the inflated balances are used to withdraw more funds than deposited. This leads to a direct loss of funds from the protocol's reserves.
Broken Token Accounting: The protocol's internal accounting would be compromised, making it impossible to accurately track user deposits and balances.
Reputation Risk: Such vulnerabilities can lead to loss of user trust and potentially cause a run on withdrawals, further destabilizing the protocol.

    function attack() external {
        // Approve PointTokenVault to spend tokens
        token.approve(address(pointVault), type(uint256).max);
        // Make the initial deposit call
        pointVault.deposit(token, 1e18, address(this));
    }

    // Fallback function that is triggered on receiving tokens
    fallback() external {
        if (token.balanceOf(address(this)) >= 1e18) {
            // Call deposit again to trigger reentrancy
            pointVault.deposit(token, 1e18, address(this));
        }
    }

        pointVault = new PointTokenVault();
        token = new MockERC20("Mock Token", "MTKN", 18);

        // Mint tokens to attacker contract
        token.mint(address(this), 100e18);
        
        // Deploy MaliciousReentrancy contract
        attackerContract = new MaliciousReentrancy(pointVault, token);

        // Approve attacker contract to use tokens
        token.transfer(address(attackerContract), 10e18);
    }

    function testReentrancyAttack() public {
        vm.expectRevert(); // Expecting a reentrancy attack revert or protection mechanism
        attackerContract.attack();
        
        // Check that the vault's balance hasn't changed incorrectly
        assertEq(pointVault.balances(address(attackerContract), token), 0);
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

To prevent reentrancy attacks, follow these mitigation strategies:

Use Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:
Update the contract’s internal state before making any external calls. For example, move the balance update logic before the token transfer in the deposit function.
Utilize Reentrancy Guard:
Implement ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin to prevent reentrant calls.
