# Protocol expect only whitelisted tokens to be deposited and Fee on Transfers tokens to be wrapped but no check/system in place to ensure this

### Details

Protocol expect only whitelisted tokens to be deposited, and that Rebased and Fee on Transfers tokens be wrapped before deposits; however, there is no system in place within the protocol or `PointTokenVault::deposit` to ensure this. The implication for this is that malicious tokens can be deposited into the protocol and for Fees on transfer tokens, while for a fee on transfer tokens, when multiple users makes deposit, the `balances[_receiver]` might be higher than the actual value.

Protocol also assumes that users will wrap any Rebasing and fee-on-transfer tokens before depositing but there is no system in place to enforce this, meaning that its not appliable.

### Tool Used

### Mitigation

Introduce a only whitelisted token modifier and make the owner able to add tokens to be whitelisted and also comparing the balance before and after the safeTransferFrom() call.
