# Potential for Redemption Fees to Become Stuck in the PointTokenVault Contract

### Summary

The inability to perform partial fee withdrawals can cause a loss of entire accumulated `rewardTokenFeeAcc` for the protocol  as the contract will fail to transfer fees when the full amount cannot be withdrawn.


### Root Cause

The choice to always attempt to withdraw the full rewardTokenFee amount collected for a pToken is a mistake as it doesn't account for scenarios where partial withdrawals may be necessary.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] needs to accumulate to be greater than the maximum transferable amount of the reward token
### External pre-conditions

Reward token needs to implement a maximum transfer limit 
### Attack Path

1. Users redeem rewards over time, accumulating fees in rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId]
2. The accumulated fees exceed the maximum transferable amount per transaction of the reward token
3. Admin calls collectFees function
4. The safeTransfer call in collectFees reverts due to exceeding transfer limits
5. The entire collectFees transaction reverts, leaving all fees stuck in the contract

### Impact

The Fee Collector suffers an loss of the entire accumulated fees for the affected pointsId. The contract retains these fees but cannot distribute them. 

Please note the main underlying issue is the attempt to always transfer entire fee. It is likely that this scenario can be hit in other cases if supported e.g. rebasing reward tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a partial fee withdrawal mechanism
