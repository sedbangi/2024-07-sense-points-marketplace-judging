# Rumpel Guard allows arbitrary contract exception with fallback handler

### Summary

The rumpel guard allows the safe wallet to call any contract as long as the calldata is zero. Therefor the fallback handler of the called contract allows the user to execute arbitrary code.

### Root Cause

The rumpel guard assumes any call with no selector is only used to transfer ETH [see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/rumpel-wallet/src/RumpelGuard.sol#L70-L75). This can be an issue is the receiving contract has some sophisticated logic inside the fallback handler. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, depending on the receiving contract. Paired with the ability to execute i.e. approve calls (if they are allowed in the `allowedCalls` mapping [see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/rumpel-wallet/src/RumpelGuard.sol#L75-L80)), this can lead some unexpected behaviors.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. ETH transfers are allowed

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Use a fake ETH transfer to call an external contract (fallback function)

### Impact

The user can execute arbitrary fallback functions.

This vulnerability poses significant risks, as it allows the user to invoke arbitrary calls, which could be exploited in various ways depending on the specific context of the protocol. The severity of the impact hinges on the protocolâ€™s interactions with external systems, including which protocols or tokens are integrated and what types of calls are permitted or restricted.

To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to limit the gas available for these calls, thereby reducing the potential for exploitation and ensuring more controlled execution with minimal impact to users.

### PoC

If `data.length` is zero and ETH transfers are allowed, the guard does not revert [see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/rumpel-wallet/src/RumpelGuard.sol#L70-L75).

### Mitigation

Consider limiting the maximum gas for the external call by using the [uint256 baseGas](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/af53bdf82cda7530783b1ca5530afd12ea82cbb2/contracts/base/GuardManager.sol#L29-L41) parameter inside the `checkTransaction` function. Allowing a little bit more than 21k but not infinite gas, limits what code can be executed.

Alternatively, dont allow external ETH transfers to contracts by also checking `.isContract()` before approving the call. While safer, this approach would limit interaction with smart contract wallets.
