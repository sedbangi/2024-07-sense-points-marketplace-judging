# Reentrancy attack in the claimPTokens, redeemRewards function

## Summary
If the _receiver is a contract that is designed to exploit reentrancy, there is a potential for a reentrancy attack in the claimPTokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The pTokens[pointsId].mint(_receiver, _claim.amountToClaim - pTokenFee); is an external call to another contract (the pToken contract) and transfers tokens to the _receiver. If _receiver is a contract that can execute code upon receiving tokens, and the pToken contract calls a function in _receiver during or after minting (e.g., a callback function like onERC20Received), the _receiver could attempt to re-enter the claimPTokens function or other functions in the contract before the state is fully updated.
This vulnerability could also happen in redeemRewards function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a nonReentrant modifier to protect the claimPTokens function from being called again before the first execution is complete.
Implement checks or restrictions on the type of contracts that can be set as _receiver to prevent interacting with potentially malicious contracts.
Modify same in redeemRewards function
