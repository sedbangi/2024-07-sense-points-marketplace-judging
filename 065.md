# Tokens could be locked or loss in deposit and withdraw function when _receiver is the contract itself

## Summary
If the _receiver is set to the contract itself (this) or address(0), there is a risk that the contract could inadvertently transfer tokens to itself, leading to potential issues such as locked tokens or unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user calls deposit with _receiver set to the contract’s own address (address(this)), the function will proceed to credit the contract’s balance to itself. The contract’s internal balances mapping will record that the contract itself holds a balance of the tokens, even though the actual tokens are already in the contract’s possession as part of its overall balance. This could lead to confusion or inaccuracies if other parts of the contract logic rely on balances[address(this)]. For address(0), token loss will happen.

If a user calls withdraw with _receiver set to the contract's own address (address(this)), the contract will attempt to transfer tokens from itself to itself. So the tokens will be frozen in this contract and the emitted event indicating that a withdrawal occurred, but in reality, the tokens never left the contract, which could mislead observers or off-chain systems.

## Recommendation
Add a check to prevent the _receiver from being the contract itself and address(0).
`require(_receiver != address(this), "Cannot deposit to the contract itself");`
