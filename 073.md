# Risk of loss of funds if users mistakenly sends funds to address zero through `PointTokenVault::deposit`


### Details 
```
 function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }
        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }

```
There is no check on parameter `_receiver` in the deposit function above, and no guarantee that users will not mistakenly input a zero address. The implication of when a zero address is passed is that the user loses control over his/her asset(s).


###  Recommendations
Require that `_receiver` is not `0``.
