# rumpel wallet may not work with signatures from standard ERC1271 wallets

## Summary
some versions of safe don't work with signatures from standard ERC12271 wallets
## Vulnerability Detail
According to this comment in RumpelGuard.sol, Rumpel wallet will be compatible with Safe v1.3.0-libs.0
```solidity
// @dev Compatible with Safe v1.3.0-libs.0, the last Safe Ethereum mainnet release, so it can't use module execution hooks.
```

If the safe version on which Rumpel wallet is built on is v1.3.0, rumpel wallet won't work with signatures from standard ERC1271 wallets and here's why:

v1.3.0 safe version defaults to the old `MAGIC_VAULE` when checking if the signature is correct:

https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/v1.3.0/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L285

```solidity
require(ISignatureValidator(currentOwner).isValidSignature(data, contractSignature) == EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE, "GS024");
```

https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account/blob/v1.3.0/contracts/interfaces/ISignatureValidator.sol
```solidity
contract ISignatureValidatorConstants {
    // bytes4(keccak256("isValidSignature(bytes,bytes)")
    bytes4 internal constant EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE = 0x20c13b0b;
}
```
As Per [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) standard ERC1271_MAGIC_VAULE should be `0x1626ba7e` instead of `0x20c13b0b` and function name should be `isValidSignature(bytes32,bytes)` instead of `isValidSignature(bytes,bytes)`. Due to this, signature verifier contract go fallback function and return unexpected value and never return ERC1271_MAGIC_VALUE and always revert execTransaction function.

## Impact
rumpel wallet may not work with signatures from standard ERC1271 wallets if it is built on  Safe v1.3.0-libs.0

## Recommendation
Don't use version  v1.3.0,  use Safe 1.5.0+
