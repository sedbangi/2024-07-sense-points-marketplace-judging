# Apply minting fee in `convertRewardsToPTokens()` function

## Summary
absence of applying minting fee when minting `pToken` in the `convertRewardsToPTokens()` function
## Vulnerability Detail
The minting fee is created to be charged on minting a `pToken` but it's not implemented in the `convertRewardsToPTokens()` function, when `pTokens` are minted
## Impact
Users get more `pToken` than deserved and the fee collector realises losses because of this

## Recommendation
Charge a minting fee when minting `pTokens` in the `convertRewardsToPTokens()` function, like in the `claimPTokens()` function
