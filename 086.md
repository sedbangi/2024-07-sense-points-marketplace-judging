# `PointTokenVault` contract can not mint.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
in PointTokenVault::claimPTokens and PointTokenVault::convertRewardsToPTokens those functions are callling `mint` function in Ptoken contract.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L251
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L159
but in PToken contract the mint function is restricted to only SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PToken.sol#L21
and this role is assigned to msg.sender in  PToken contract,
that means the transaction will revert when the caller is PointTokenVault contract

## Impact
transaction will revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allow the PointTokenVault.sol to call this function.
