# Anyone can arbitrage the rewarding logic by sandwiching

### Summary

The exploit involves an attacker timing their actions around the `updateRoot()` and `setRedemption()` functions in the `PointTokenVault` contract. By staking a large amount of tokens just before the Merkle root is updated, the attacker secures eligibility for rewards intended for long-term stakers, despite staking for a short period. The root cause is the snapshot-based reward distribution model that only considers the amount staked at a specific moment, allowing the attacker to disrupt the protocolâ€™s economic incentives.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability lies in the design of the rewards distribution mechanism in the [`PointTokenVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol) contract, specifically within the [`setRedemption()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L313-L319) and [`updateRoot()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L300-L304) functions. These functions rely solely on the amount of `pointEarningToken` staked at the time of the `Merkle tree` snapshot (updateRoot), without considering the duration for which the tokens have been staked. This allows late stakers to exploit the system by staking large amounts just before the snapshot, enabling them to receive rewards comparable to long-term stakers. The absence of a temporal factor in the rewards allocation process undermines the incentives for sustained participation in the protocol.

> Additionally, the protocol has mentioned the potential automation of this snapshot process. This could further facilitate the timing-based exploit by attackers, exacerbating the issue and allowing for more precise manipulation of the reward distribution.

**Note**: _Although Toly's proof shows a lesser amount than Vitalik's in the test, this detail is irrelevant because the snapshot captures the staked values at a specific point in time. This means Toly could have been staking for a much shorter duration but with a significantly higher token value, thereby earning the same or more rewards than Vitalik._

### Attack Path

1. Vitalik initially deposits 2 `pointEarningToken` into the PointTokenVault. This early deposit sets him up as a long-term staker with an allocation of `2e18` points in the `Merkle tree`.

2. "Toly also initially deposits a small amount or close to 0 pointEarningToken into the PointTokenVault, setting himself up as a long-term staker with a minimal allocation of points in the Merkle tree.

3. Toly monitors the `PointTokenVault` . He waits until just before the `merkleUpdater` calls the `updateRoot()` function to refresh the Merkle tree with the latest staking data.

> **Note**: the protocol has mentioned the potential automation of this snapshot process.

4. Just before the `updateRoot()` is executed, Toly frontrunns `updateRoot()` depositing to the amount of 2 `pointEarningToken` into the `PointTokenVault`, ensuring his deposit points is included in the updated Merkle tree, ensuring his deposit of 2e18 points is included in the updated Merkle tree.

5. The `merkleUpdater` updates the Merkle root with the new staking data, capturing both Vitalik's and Toly's deposits.

6. The `operator` uses the `setRedemption()` function to set a 1:1 ratio for rewards, so each staked token can be exchanged for 1 rewardToken.

7. Vitalik claims his rewardToken allocation first, using his Merkle proof, and receives 2 rewardToken based on his 2e18 staked tokens.

8. Toly then claims his rewardToken allocation using his Merkle proof. Despite staking at the last moment, he also receives 2 rewardToken, the same as Vitalik, despite staking his tokens for a much shorter duration.

- Both Vitalik and Toly end up with 2 rewardToken each, showing that Toly managed to exploit the system by staking at the last minute and receiving rewards comparable to Vitalik, who staked earlier.

### Mitigation

To mitigate the stepwise jump issue in reward distribution, consider implementing continuous or time-weighted rewards accrual, penalizing last-minute staking, and using multiple or averaged snapshots. These strategies ensure rewards are more fairly distributed based on sustained participation rather than timing. Additionally, introducing lock-up periods or randomized reward distribution can further discourage gaming the system.
