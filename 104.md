//lack of access control =>allows any user to trust another account for claiming tokens on their behalf.
    function trustClaimer(address _account, bool _isTrusted) public {
        trustedClaimers[msg.sender][_account] = _isTrusted;
        emit TrustClaimer(msg.sender, _account, _isTrusted);
    }

### Mitigation

This function should include additional checks or limitations, such as only allowing a certain set of predefined accounts to be trusted claimers or adding an event for when this is set, allowing users to monitor such changes.
