# Users may be prevented from claiming earned rewards

## Summary
The ability to pause pToken burns can prevent users from claiming their earned rewards, contradicting the principle that users should be able to redeem their rewards at any time.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PointTokenVault::redeemRewards` function calls the `PToken::burn` function of the corresponding pToken. However, the pToken contract includes a `PToken::pause` function that can disable burning. Since the `PointTokenVault::redeemRewards` function involves burning points, if this functionality is paused, the user will not be able to claim their reward. Therefore, the ability for users to claim rewards is not unrestricted and depends on the PAUSE_ROLE of the point tokens.

## Impact
Users may be unable to access their earned rewards, leading to a loss of trust in the system and potential financial losses for users who cannot redeem their rewards when needed.

```solidity
function redeemRewards(Claim calldata _claim, address _receiver) public {
    // ... (previous code omitted for brevity)

    uint256 pTokensToBurn = FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken);
    pTokens[pointsId].burn(msg.sender, pTokensToBurn);

    // ... (remaining code omitted for brevity)
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the ability to pause the burn function in the pToken contract, or implement a mechanism that ensures rewards can always be claimed even if burning is paused.
