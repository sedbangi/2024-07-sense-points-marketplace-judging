# CREATE2 Address Collision Vulnerability in `RumpelWalletFactory.sol` Protocol

## Summary
The `RumpelWalletFactory::createWallet` function allows users to specify a custom salt for the `CREATE2` operation when deploying new Safe wallet. This user-controlled salt can lead to address collisions, where an attacker can deploy a malicious contract to the same address as a future Safe wallet.

## Vulnerability Detail
   - The attacker can brute-force various salt values to predict the resulting Safe addresses before deployment (using the deterministic nature of `CREATE2`).
   - Because of the `saltNonce[msg.sender]++`, it could increase the possibility of brute-forcing the saltNonce and the next saltNonce.
   - They can then deploy their own contract at one of these addresses using the same salt.
   - They can manipulate contract logic, set approvals, or transfer assets, affecting or controlling the funds in the wallet.
   The feasibility, detailed techniques, and hardware requirements for finding an address collision have been well documented in several sources:
[1: A past issue on Sherlock describing this attack.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap-judging/issues/90)
[2: EIP-3607, which rationale is this exact attack. The EIP is in final state.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3607)
[3: A blog post discussing the cost (money and time) of this exact attack.](https://mystenlabs.com/blog/ambush-attacks-on-160bit-objectids-addresses)

## Impact
Address collisions can lead to the complete draining of tokens from a Safe contract, resulting in significant financial loss.

```solidity

        uint256 threshold,

    ) external whenNotPaused returns (address) {
        address safe = proxyFactory.createProxyWithNonce(
            safeSingleton,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(

                owners,
                threshold,
                initializationScript, // Contract with initialization logic
                abi.encodeWithSelector(InitializationScript.initialize.selector, rumpelModule, rumpelGuard, initCalls), // Add module and guard + initial calls
                compatibilityFallback, // fallbackHandler
                address(0), // paymentToken
                0, // payment
                address(0) // paymentReceiver
            ),
@audit=>     saltNonce[msg.sender]++ // For deterministic address generation
        );

        emit SafeCreated(safe, owners, threshold);

        return safe;
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Avoid letting users control the salt used in `CREATE2` operations.
2. Include additional unique data like `block.timestamp` and `block.number` with the user-provided salt to make finding hash collisions more difficult.
