# Users will bypass redemption fees in `PointTokenVault`

### Summary

Incorrect updating of `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` will cause a loss of revenue for the protocol as users will exploit the [`redeemRewards` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) to avoid paying fees on subsequent redemptions.


### Root Cause

In [point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol:redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) the `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` value is not correctly updated when partial fees are applied.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to claim PTokens to set `claimedPTokens[user][pointsId]` to be greater than 0.
2. `redemptionFee` needs to be set to a value greater than 0.


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User claims a large amount of PTokens, e.g., 1,000,000.
2. User redeems a small portion of PTokens, e.g., 1 PToken, which is feeless.
3. feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[user][pointsId] is updated to 1.
4. User redeems the remaining 999,999 PTokens.
5. Since feelesslyRedeemable (999,999) >= pTokensToBurn (999,999), no fee is charged.
6. Steps 4-5 can be repeated for future claims, always avoiding fees.


### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of expected redemption fees. Users can bypass fees on the majority of their redemptions, potentially leading to significant revenue loss for the protocol.

### PoC


Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice claims 1,000,000 PTokens for a specific `pointsId.` This sets her `claimedPTokens[Alice][pointsId]` to 1,000,000.

2. Alice decides to redeem 1 PToken:
   - She calls `redeemRewards()` with `amountToClaim = 1`.
   - Since this is her first redemption, it's feeless (`feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn`).
   - The function updates `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[Alice][pointsId]` to 1.

3. Alice then redeems the remaining 999,999 PTokens:
   - She calls `redeemRewards()` again with `amountToClaim = 999,999`.
   - The function calculates `feelesslyRedeemable = claimedPTokens - feelesslyRedeemedPTokens = 1,000,000 - 1 = 999,999`.
   - Since `feelesslyRedeemable (999,999) >= pTokensToBurn (999,999)`, the redemption is considered feeless.
   - No fee is charged, and Alice receives the full amount of reward tokens.

4. The issue lies in the `else` block of the `redeemRewards()` function:
   ```solidity
   if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
       feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
   }
   ```
   This condition is never met in our scenario, so `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` is not updated correctly.

5. As a result, Alice has redeemed all her PTokens without paying any fees, despite the protocol intending to charge a fee on the majority of her redemption.
6. Alice can repeat this process for future claims, always avoiding fees on the bulk of her redemptions.



### Mitigation

To fix this issue, update the `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` value correctly in all cases within the [`redeemRewards` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226)
