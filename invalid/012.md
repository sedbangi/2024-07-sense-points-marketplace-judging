# Lack of `delegatecall` Return Value Check in `execute` Function Can Lead to Silent Failures

### Summary

The absence of a return value check for `delegatecall` in the `execute` function will cause an undetected failure in the external call for the `PointTokenVault` contract as the function will return `true` even if the `delegatecall` fails. This could allow the contract to continue operating under the assumption that a critical operation succeeded when it did not.

### Root Cause

In [PointTokenVault.sol, lines 365-373](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L365-L373), the root cause is the missing check for the return value of `delegatecall`, which can result in the function returning `true` even when the delegated call fails.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `PointTokenVault` contract must execute the `execute` function.
2. The `delegatecall` operation within `execute` must fail (e.g., due to insufficient gas, an error in the called contract, or an invalid operation).
3. The return value of `delegatecall` is not checked, leading to the incorrect assumption that the call succeeded.

### External pre-conditions

1.  An external contract or user with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` must invoke the execute function.
2.  The external contract called via `delegatecall` must have an erroneous condition or require more gas than provided.

### Attack Path

1. The `execute` function is invoked by an admin or external contract.
2. The `delegatecall` is made to the target contract with a specific amount of gas.
3. The target contractâ€™s function fails (e.g., due to running out of gas or encountering a revert condition).
4. The `delegatecall` return value (success) is not checked; thus, the function continues execution and returns `true`.
5. The caller assumes that the operation was successful, leading to potential inconsistencies or further vulnerabilities in the system.

### Impact

The `PointTokenVault` contract could operate under `false` assumptions, causing potential loss of funds or operational errors. The affected party could suffer an approximate loss of the value related to the failed operation, which could include failed reward claims, token transfers, or other critical operations. The attacker may gain the ability to exploit further operations under this `false` assumption.

### PoC

Extended from [PointTokenVault.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/test/PointTokenVault.t.sol#L21)

Add this function in the [CallEcho](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/test/PointTokenVault.t.sol#L888-L892) contract:
```solidity
   function failingFunction() public pure {
        require(false, "This function always fails");
   }
```
```solidity
    function test_Execute_NoRevertOnFailure() public {
        
        CallEcho callEcho = new CallEcho();

        uint256 GAS_LIMIT = 1e9;

        // Execute a failing call
        vm.prank(admin);

        bool success = pointTokenVault.execute(
            address(callEcho), abi.encodeWithSelector(CallEcho.failingFunction.selector), GAS_LIMIT
        );

        // Check that the call did not revert and the function returned false
        assertFalse(success, "The execute function should not revert, but should return false on failure.");
    }
```
Run the following command to execute the POC: `forge test --match-test test_Execute_NoRevertOnFailure`

### Mitigation

Ensure that the return value of `delegatecall` is checked. If `success` is false, the transaction should revert with an appropriate error message:
```diff
function execute(address _to, bytes memory _data, uint256 _txGas)
    external
    onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    returns (bool success)
{
    assembly {
        success := delegatecall(_txGas, _to, add(_data, 0x20), mload(_data), 0, 0)
    }
+   require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
}
```
