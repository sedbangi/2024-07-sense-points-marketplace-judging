# someone causes createWallet to revert for the original attempt deploy by front-running eventually blocking functionality

## Summary
1. createWallet function for RumpelWalletFactory can be front run when attackers observe the pending transaction on the blockchain network.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The second person can easily determine the exact value of the transaction arguments such as; saltNonce[msg.sender]++, and use it to calculate the same wallet address. This means that if they set a higher gas for their transaction, they can potentially create a wallet at the same address, without "stealing" the address.
2. The createWallet function can be front run in a way that the deployment can be incorrectly assumed to have failed since it was successfully deployed on the front-runner transaction's createWallet, and this informatiomation will hold true. 

## Impact
1. HIGH LIKELIHOOD LOW IMPACT
2. The implemented protocol as is may deploy a given address, and deploy it at the front-runner transaction, and fail the original transaction, given both transactions are with the exact same arguments. However, different gas. Since the saltNonce[msg.sender]++ will not be increased at each deployment was front-run, the attackers will make it increasingly difficult for honest participants to easily deploy wallets, and the honest participants will be required to pass arbitrary combinations of args; owners, threshold, initCalls, since the default args have been allocated at the ETH mainnet already for a specific nonce, and yet no nonces incremented can be observed for all honest partakers who inherently will experience grief, and DoS, and violation given bad actor someone else will be spending all the nonce on behalf of honest participants yet the factory contract will be unaware for the dishonest spent of every nonce.
