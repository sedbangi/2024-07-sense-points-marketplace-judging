# feelesslyRedeemedPTokens variable is incorrectly updated on some occasions

## Summary

In the current functionality of `PointTokenVault`, the user may be able to feelessly redeem up to the amount of the tokens that they claimed. But if they try to redeem tokens that were bought on the market at the same time, `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` mapping will be incorrectly updated.

## Vulnerability Detail

Take a look at the current process of redemption:

https://github.com/sense-finance/point-tokenization-vault/blob/dev/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L194-221
```solidity
  uint256 claimed = claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];
        uint256 feelesslyRedeemed = feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];

        // The amount of pTokens that are free to redeem without fee.
        uint256 feelesslyRedeemable = claimed - feelesslyRedeemed;

        uint256 rewardsToTransfer;
        uint256 fee;

        if (feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn) {
            // If all of the pTokens are free to redeem without fee.
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim;
            feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += pTokensToBurn;
        } else {
            // If some or all of the pTokens need to be charged a fee.
            uint256 redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn - feelesslyRedeemable;
            // fee = amount of pTokens that are not feeless * rewardsPerPToken * redemptionFee
            fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
                FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken), redemptionFee
            );

            rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += fee;
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim - fee;

            if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
                feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
            }
        }

```
Let's imagine the following scenario:

1. User has claimed 1000 tokens before so that `feelesslyRedeemed` is now 1000 as well as `claimed`.
2. Now he has 1000 more tokens to claim meaing that `claimed` was updated to 2000 but additionally he bought 500 tokens from the market so these tokens are not supposed to be feeless when redeeming.
3. User wants to burn all new 1500 tokens right away.
4. So the variables inside of the `redeemRewards()` currently have these values:

```solidity
claimed = 2000 (as the user claimed new 1000 tokens but has not redeemed yet)
feeleslyRedeemed = 1000 (from the previous claim)
feelesslyRedeemable = 2000 - 1000 = 1000 (he should claim new 1000 tokens without a fee so this is right)
pTokensToBurn = 1500 (so 1000 should be feeless and 500 should be with a fee)
```

The first if-statement is skipped as `pTokensToBurn > feelesslyRedeemable`:

https://github.com/sense-finance/point-tokenization-vault/blob/dev/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L203-206
```solidity
 if (feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn) {
            // If all of the pTokens are free to redeem without fee.
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim;
            feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += pTokensToBurn;

```

So else statement is triggered:

https://github.com/sense-finance/point-tokenization-vault/blob/dev/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L209-220
```solidity
uint256 redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn - feelesslyRedeemable;
            // fee = amount of pTokens that are not feeless * rewardsPerPToken * redemptionFee
            fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
                FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken), redemptionFee
            );

            rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += fee;
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim - fee;

            if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
                feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
            }
```
The problem is in the last line that compares `feelesslyRedeemed` with `claimed`. `claimed` currently equals to 2000 and `feelesslyRedeemed` is 1000 (from the previous claim). They are not equal => `feelesslyReedemedPTokens` variable would be updated even though the tokens were not feelessly redeemed (only 500 tokens would be redeemed but with a fee).

## Impact

Variable `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` is incorrectly updated showing that the tokens were feelessly redeemed even though they were not in reality.

## Code Snippet

Provided above.

## Tool used

Manual Review.

## Recommendation

Update the logic so the variable is updated correctly.
