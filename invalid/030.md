# No withdraw function for `withdrawing` native ETH

## Summary
No withdraw function for `withdrawing` native ETH

## Vulnerability Detail
There is `receive()` in pointsTokenVault.sol contract, which means protocol is `expected` to receive native ETH & also there is a test in pointsTokenVault.t.sol file, which tests sending native ETH in the contract.
```solidity
    contract PointTokenVault is UUPSUpgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, MulticallUpgradeable {
         ....
         receive() external payable {}
    }
```
```solidity
function test_ReceiveETH() public payable {
        // Amount of ETH to send
        uint256 amountToSend = 1 ether;

        // Record the initial balance of the PointTokenVault
        uint256 initialBalance = address(pointTokenVault).balance;

        // Send ETH to the PointTokenVault
        (bool sent,) = address(pointTokenVault).call{value: 1 ether}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");

        // Check the new balance of the PointTokenVault
        uint256 newBalance = address(pointTokenVault).balance;
        assertEq(newBalance, initialBalance + amountToSend);
    }
```

But the problem is, there is no withdraw function that allow admin/owner to withdraw that native ETH

## Impact
ETH will stuck in the contract forever

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make a withdraw function that allow admin/owner to withdraw those ETH
