# Users will be charged more redemptionFee due to improper fee calculation.

### Summary

Since the division is rounded up, the amount collected when calculating the fee is greater than the actual `amountToClaim`, and the user will pay more redemptionFees.
For example, user want to claim 1000 rewardToken(amountToClaim = 1000), and rewardsPerPToken = 9e18. So the pTokensToBurn = 1000 * 1e18 / 99e18 + 1 = 11. Assume the feelesslyRedeemable = 0 and redemptionFee = 1e17. So the fee = 11 * 99e18 / 1e18 * 1e17 / 1e18 + 1 =  109 rewardTokens. But actually the fee should no more than 1000* 1*17 / 1e18 = 100. That is, user pay more redemptionFees.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L212
In the function `redeemRewards`, the calculation

```solidity
FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken)
```

may be larger than `amountToClaim`, causing more fees.

### Mitigation

If the `FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken)` is larger than amountToClaim, it should be replaced with amountToClaim.
