# Improper Deposit Cap Enforcement Due to Unsolicited Token Transfers

### Summary

The `PointTokenVault` contract checks the deposit cap by referencing the total balance of the token in the contract using `_token.balanceOf(address(this))`. This method does not explicitly track actual deposits but rather considers the total balance held by the contract. As a result, unsolicited or external token transfers to the contract can prematurely trigger the deposit cap, blocking legitimate deposits from users.

### Root Cause

The flawed approach lies in using _token.balanceOf(address(this)) to enforce the deposit cap:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L118C13-L119C44

```solidity
if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();

```
This method does not differentiate between tokens deposited by users and unsolicited token transfers sent directly to the contract. Consequently, the total balance of tokens (including unintended or external transfers) is considered when checking against the deposit cap. This improper tracking mechanism leads to a situation where unsolicited token transfers can artificially trigger the deposit cap, blocking genuine deposits from occurring. 


### Internal pre-conditions

The contract has a defined cap for deposits for specific ERC20 tokens.


### External pre-conditions

An external or unsolicited transfer of tokens to the contract has occurred, thereby affecting the balance.
A user attempts to deposit tokens, which, combined with the current total balance (inclusive of unsolicited transfers), exceeds the preset cap.

### Attack Path

Initial Setup:

The contract has a low deposit cap set for a specific ERC20 token.
Unsolicited Transfer:

An external party or contract sends unsolicited tokens to the vault contract address, increasing the token balance observed by `_token.balanceOf(address(this))`.
Legitimate Deposit Attempt:

A legitimate user attempts to deposit tokens into the vault.
Cap Enforcement Triggered:

The contract calculates the new balance considering the current balance (which includes the unsolicited transfers).
The sum of the unsolicited transfers and the user's intended deposit exceeds the deposit cap.
Deposit Failure:

The contract reverts the deposit transaction with the DepositExceedsCap error, blocking the user's legitimate deposit due to superficial cap enforcement.

### Impact

External or malicious actors can block legitimate users from making deposits by sending unsolicited tokens to the contract. This artificially inflates the balance, prematurely triggering the deposit cap.

### PoC

```solidity
     function test_DepositCapsWithUnsolicitedTransfers() public {
    // Deploy a new mock token
    MockERC20 newMockToken = new MockERC20("New Test Token", "NTT", 18);

    // Set a cap for the new token
    uint256 capAmount = 1e18; // 1 token cap
    vm.prank(operator);
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit CapSet(address(newMockToken), 0, capAmount);
    pointTokenVault.setCap(address(newMockToken), capAmount);

    // Mint tokens to vitalik and the vault directly (unsolicited transfer)
    newMockToken.mint(vitalik, 2e18); // 2 tokens
    newMockToken.mint(address(pointTokenVault), 0.5e18); // 0.5 token unsolicited transfer

    // Approve and try to deposit more than the cap (including unsolicited transfer)
    vm.startPrank(vitalik);
    newMockToken.approve(address(pointTokenVault), 2e18);
    vm.expectRevert(PointTokenVault.DepositExceedsCap.selector);
    pointTokenVault.deposit(newMockToken, 1e18, vitalik); // Try to deposit 1 token which would exceed cap due to 0.5 unsolicited token
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Adjust the scenario to deposit within the cap considering unsolicited tokens
    vm.startPrank(vitalik);
    newMockToken.approve(address(pointTokenVault), 2e18);
    vm.expectRevert(PointTokenVault.DepositExceedsCap.selector);
    pointTokenVault.deposit(newMockToken, 0.51e18, vitalik); // Try to deposit 0.51 token which would exceed total 1 token cap due to 0.5 unsolicited token
    vm.stopPrank();
}

```

### Mitigation

The contract should maintain a dedicated tracking mechanism for total deposited tokens, separate from the contract's balance. This can be achieved by introducing a new state variable and updating it within the deposit and withdraw functions.

Introduce a New Mapping: Add a new mapping to track the total deposits for each ERC20 token.

```solidity
mapping(ERC20 => uint256) public totalDeposits;

```

Update the deposit Function: Modify the deposit function to add the deposited amount to the `totalDeposits` mapping.

```solidity
function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
    uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

    if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
        // Use totalDeposits mapping here instead of _token.balanceOf(address(this))
        if (_amount + totalDeposits[_token] > cap) {
            revert DepositExceedsCap();
        }
    }

    _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

    balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

    // Update total deposits
    totalDeposits[_token] += _amount;

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
}

```
Update the withdraw Function: Modify the withdraw function to subtract the withdrawn amount from the totalDeposits mapping.

```solidity
function withdraw(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
    balances[msg.sender][_token] -= _amount;

    _token.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);

    // Update total deposits
    totalDeposits[_token] -= _amount;

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
}

```
