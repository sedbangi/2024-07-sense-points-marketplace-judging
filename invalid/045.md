# Missing check for zero amount

## Summary
In the documentation, it is mentioned that Any type of ERC20 token, except (They're assumed to not be reentrant)
. So users can use weird tokens. Some tokens (e.g. LEND) revert when transferring a zero value amount. example: [RevertZero.sol](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/blob/main/src/RevertZero.sol). This introduces a risk related to revert on 0 amount
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Revert on Zero Amount: When balance is zero, the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` method from most ERC20 token contracts will revert. This behavior is intended to prevent unintentional transfers of zero tokens, which could be seen as an error in many token implementations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To handle revert on zero amount , modify the functions to check the actual amount before safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom
