# User can withdraw with an arbitrary ERC20 as the input, causing unexpected behavior

### Summary

In PointTokenizationVault:130, User can send an arbitrary ERC20 token as the input. This could cause unexpected issues. Additionally, Solmate's SafeTransferLib does not check for the token's existence, which can lead to failed transactions. A user could also deploy their own ERC20 with a manipulated transfer function (e.g. transfer is successful, but returns false/revert to the caller), causing unexpected behavior.

### Root Cause

In PointTokenizationVault:130 User can input arbitrary ERC20 token, causing unexpected behaviors.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

User could create their own ERC20 contract with a manipulated transfer function (e.g. transfer is successful, but returns false/reverts) and use that as input


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Unexpected behaviors

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a mapping of the tokens that are valid to PointTokenizationVault storage that can be set by the owner and check if the input ERC20 in deposit/withdraw is a valid token in the mapping. This will reduce the surface area of your protocol to only be able to interact with the ERC20 tokens you expect to interact with.
