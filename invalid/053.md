# ETH cannot be withdrawn from PointTokenVault.sol contract

## Summary
There’s a receive() function in the PointTokenVault.sol contract, but there is no function to withdraw ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail
There’s a receive() function in the PointTokenVault.sol contract, but this ETH cannot be withdrawn since there is no withdraw functionality for ETH . Therefore any ether sent to this contract would be stuck inside the contract forver.
```jsx
receive() external payable {}
```
## Impact
Stuck of funds
