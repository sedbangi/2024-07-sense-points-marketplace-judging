# Malicious user can make the deposit() function in PointTokenVault.sol contract unusable

## Summary
Malicious user can make the `deposit` unusable by purposely increasing the balance of the token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises in the `deposit()` function of the PointTokenVault.sol contract, because there is a check that uses `balanceOf`. There can be a cap for a token max deposit amount, if the cap is exceeded, users can't deposit.
```jsx
    if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }
```
They check if the current deposited amount + token's balance in the contract are more than the cap. The problem is everyone can increase the token's balance by sending tokens to the contract without using the deposit, making users unable to deposit.

## Impact

Malicious user can make the `deposit` unusable.

## Recommendation

Implement a mapping that holds token and its deposited balance in the contract, do not use `balanceOf`.
