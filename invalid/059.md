# Users that claim PTokens will pay less fess

### Summary

The protocol charges both a minting fee when users claim Ptokens via the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function, and a redemption fee when users redeem their PTokens for the reward tokens via the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function. The protocol utilizes a so called "fee on the borders" strategy and as per the readme: *We chose a "fee on the borders" strategy in the vault where users are only charged for redemption if they redeem in excess of what they minted, pToken wise.* What users can redeem without paying the redeem fee is calculated in the following way:
```solidity
    function redeemRewards(Claim calldata _claim, address _receiver) public {
        ...

        uint256 claimed = claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];
        uint256 feelesslyRedeemed = feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];

        // The amount of pTokens that are free to redeem without fee.
        uint256 feelesslyRedeemable = claimed - feelesslyRedeemed;

        uint256 rewardsToTransfer;
        uint256 fee;

        if (feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn) {
            // If all of the pTokens are free to redeem without fee.
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim;
            feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += pTokensToBurn;
        } else {
            // If some or all of the pTokens need to be charged a fee.
            uint256 redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn - feelesslyRedeemable;
            // fee = amount of pTokens that are not feeless * rewardsPerPToken * redemptionFee
            /// INFO: Equivalent to (x * y) / WAD rounded up
            fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
                FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken), redemptionFee
            );

            rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += fee;
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim - fee;

            if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
                feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
            }
        }
        ...
    }
```
However the **claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]** mapping is updated before the minting fee is applied in the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function. Thus a user can buy addition pToken via the [convertRewardsToPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L229-L254) function, where he isn't charged a minting fee, and then redeem part of the pTokens without paying a redemption fee as well, which results in the protocol collecting less fees than it should, thus the high severity.  

### Root Cause

The **claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]** mapping is updated before the minting fee is applied in the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user claims some amount of pTokens via the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function.
2. The **mintFee** is set to **0.1e18** which is **10%**, and the **redemptionFee** is set to **0.1e18** which is **10%** as well
3. Redemption is set via the [setRedemption()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L313-L319) and users can buy pTokens via the [convertRewardsToPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L229-L254) function.

### Attack Path

1. User A has a **_claim.totalClaimable** = **1e18** for **pTokenA**, and decides to claim all of his pTokens by calling the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function. He gets minted **0.9e18** pTokensA, however the **claimedPTokens** mapping for User A is set to **1e18** in the [_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L271-L296) function.
2. Now for easier calculations let's say that the **rewardToken** is **WETH** and the **rewardsPerPToken** is **1e18**, when the user calls the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function in order to redeem his **0.9e18** pTokenA he won't pay any redemption fees. So far so good.
3. User A calls the [convertRewardsToPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L229-L254) function, and convert **0.1e18 WET** for pTokensA, he is not charged any minting fee.
4. Now when User A  calls the [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L172-L226) function again, he won't have to pay redemption fee for the **0.1e18** pTokensA that he has, which results in the protocol not collecting the fees that it is supposed to. *0.1e18 \* 10% = 0.01e18*. If the fees are a bigger percentage the protocol will lose even more, this loss of fees can be accrued an all pTokens that are not merkle based, which results in big losses for the protocol. 

### Impact

Users that have claimed pTokens via the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function, will pay less fees than they are supposed to if they later buy more pTokens via the [convertRewardsToPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L229-L254) function

### Mitigation
Update the **claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]** mapping, after the minting fee is applied in the [claimPTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L142-L162) function.
