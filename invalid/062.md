# User can bypass the DELEGATECALL only to SignMessageLib by creating their own Safe

### Summary

In RumpelGuard:55, there is a restriction on only calling SignMessageLib using DELEGATECALL. However, there are no restrictions in your protocol of allowing a user to create their own safe and interact with your protocol this way, bypassing the RumpelGuard (and RumpelModule) completely. This would allow a user to DELEGATECALL anything other than SignMessageLib

### Root Cause

No restrictions in protocol of user creating their own Safe

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. User creates their own Safe

### Attack Path

1. User creates their own Safe
2. User can DELEGATECALL anything that isn't SignMessageLib

### Impact

Unrestricted access to the protocol functions using DELEGATECALL or even CALL when it is intended to restrict user actions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a mapping(Safe -> bool) in the RumpleWalletFactory and update to true whenever a RumpelWallet is created. Additionally, add a function that returns whether an address is a valid Rumpel Wallet/Safe based on the mapping. Then, you can restrict your protocol to only allowing calls/delegatecalls from your Rumpel Wallets by calling the function in RumpleWalletFactory whenever needed.

This will allow you to keep track of all your Rumpel Wallets as well.
