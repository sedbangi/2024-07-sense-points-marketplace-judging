# Fee on transfer tokens not supported

## Summary

The protocol allows fee-on-transfer tokens, but the  [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L114) function assumes the full amount is received. This discrepancy leads to incorrect balances and failed withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the [Readme(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate) states, Fee-on-transfer tokens are allowed to be used within the protocol:

>Q: If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of [weird tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20) you want to integrate?
Yes, whitelisted tokens only. They're assumed to not be reentrant, but fee-on-transfer, pausable, and blocklist tokens are OK.

If we look at the [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L114) function, we can see that the protocol assumes `_amount` of tokens were transferred:

```solidity
 function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }

        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

@>        balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```

This assumption is incorrect for non-standard ERC20 tokens like fee-on-transfer tokens. (more information on these tokens: [link](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#fee-on-transfer)).

When a fee-on-transfer token is deposited, the actual amount received will be less than the `_amount` parameter due to the transfer fee. This discrepancy leads to an inflated balance for the deposited token in the `balances` mapping. Consequently, when a withdrawal is attempted, it will fail due to insufficient funds (the recorded balance is higher than the actual balance).

## Impact

- Inaccurate balance tracking for fee-on-transfer tokens
- Failed withdrawals

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }

        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, the protocol should calculate the actual transferred amount by subtracting the balance difference between the token contract before and after the safeTransferFrom call. This will ensure the balances mapping reflects the true deposited amount.
