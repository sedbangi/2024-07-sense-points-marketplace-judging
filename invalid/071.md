# The use of delegateCall in a contract that inherits UUPS Upgradeable is discouraged

## Summary
The use of delegateCall in a contract that inherits UUPS Upgradeable is discouraged

## Vulnerability Detail
In implementation contracts, it is adviced to avoid the use delegatecall with arbitrary contracts. Previously, the primary risk was inadvertently making a delegatecall to a contract with a selfdestruct opcode, which could delete the contract code. Although the Cancun fork has addressed this by ensuring selfdestruct no longer removes contract code, it is still recommended to avoid delegatecall in implementation contracts. This caution persists because some chains may still support selfdestruct. Therefore, OpenZeppelin deems it unsafe to use delegatecall within implementation contracts.

## Impact
Delegatecall could still allow arbitrary manipulation of the contract's state, potentially corrupting or overwriting critical data.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol should consider implementing the execute function without the use of delegate call
