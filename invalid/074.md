# function Initialize hardcodes Operation Enum

### Description
function [InitiliaztionScript.Initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/rumpel-wallet/src/InitializationScript.sol#L20-L42) is called by newly created safes: 

```javascript
function initialize(address module, address guard, InitCall[] memory initCalls) external {
        ISafe safe = ISafe(address(this));
        safe.enableModule(module);
        safe.setGuard(guard);

        // Arbitrary initial calls.
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < initCalls.length; i++) {
            address to = initCalls[i].to;
            bytes memory data = initCalls[i].data;

            // Check each tx with the guard.
            RumpelGuard(guard).checkTransaction(
                to, 0, data, Enum.Operation.Call, 0, 0, 0, address(0), payable(address(0)), bytes(""), address(0)
            );

            bool success;
            assembly {
                success := call(sub(gas(), 500), to, 0, add(data, 0x20), mload(data), 0, 0)
            }

            if (!success) revert InitializationFailed();

            emit InitialCall(to, data);
        }
    }
```

Inside this function a loop is entered that goes over every transaction.

The `Enum.Operation` consists of two options:

```javascript
library Enum {
    enum Operation {
        Call,
        DelegateCall
    }
}
```

But it never is able to be assigned as `DelegateCall` even if this were to be the case, since the following line of code hardcodes the Enum to `Call`:

```javascript
            RumpelGuard(guard).checkTransaction(
=>                to, 0, data, Enum.Operation.Call, 0, 0, 0, address(0), payable(address(0)), bytes(""), address(0)
            );
```

This means that `checkTransaction` is always called with the `Operation.Call` enum even if this initial call would be of a delegatecall. 


### Recommendation
we recommend not hardcoding the enum to `Call`, this will cause for incorrect assignments of the enum whenever dealing with delegatecalls
