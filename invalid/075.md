# Mint & Burn functionality differ in rounding

### Description
function [convertRewardsToPTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L229-L253)] allows for a user to convert his rewards into points. This function will ultimately mint pTokens:

```javascript
    function convertRewardsToPTokens(address _receiver, bytes32 _pointsId, uint256 _amountToConvert) public {
//..Omitted code
=>        uint256 pTokensToMint = FixedPointMathLib.divWadDown(_amountToConvert, rewardsPerPToken); // Round down for mint.
//..Omitted code
```

`pTokensToMint` is calculated by performing `divWadDown`.

Now whenever a user wants to convert his points into rewards he can do so by calling `redeemRewards`. This will burn pTokens and convert them into rewards

```javascript
    function redeemRewards(Claim calldata _claim, address _receiver) public {
//..Omitted code
=>        uint256 pTokensToBurn = FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken);
        pTokens[pointsId].burn(msg.sender, pTokensToBurn);
//..Omitted code
```

We see that `pTokensToBurn` is calculated by rounding upwards using `divWadUp`, this is contrary to the minting system which rounds downwards. 

This can create problems when attempting to burn the minted `pTokens` because the burning process rounds upwards while the minting process rounds downwards. As a result, the burn operation might attempt to burn one more token than what was actually minted, leading to a failure of the burn transaction.


### Recommendation
make sure that the minting & burning process is equal when it comes to rounding, we suggest using `divWadDown` whenever burning to remain consistency
