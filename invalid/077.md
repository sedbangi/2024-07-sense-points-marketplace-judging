# User can net profit by frontrunning setRedemption

### Description
function [setRedemption](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L313-L319) allows for an `OPERATOR_ROLE` to modify the `_rewardsPerToken`, this can also be done while the redemption is live, as per the comments:

```javascript
    // Can be used to unlock reward token redemption (can also modify a live redemption, so use with care).
    function setRedemption(bytes32 _pointsId, ERC20 _rewardToken, uint256 _rewardsPerPToken, bool _isMerkleBased)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        redemptions[_pointsId] = RedemptionParams(_rewardToken, _rewardsPerPToken, _isMerkleBased);
        emit RewardRedemptionSet(_pointsId, _rewardToken, _rewardsPerPToken, _isMerkleBased);
    }
```

This opens up a way for a user to net profit by performing the following actions:

- User holds a certain amount of rewards
- `setRedemption` is called to increase the reward per token
- User frontruns this by calling `ConvertRewardsToPTokens` 
- User can now `redeemRewards` for a higher reward per token value

This allows the user to mint additional tokens while also earning a higher reward for each token.

### Recommendation
implement logic to prevent this scenario from occurring.
