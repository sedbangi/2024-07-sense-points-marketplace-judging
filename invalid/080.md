# Fee-less Design May Threaten Going-Concern Of Protocol

### Summary

In the `claimRewards` function of the `PointTokenVault.sol` contract on `Lines: 195 - 199`, users can claim `pTokens` as rewards without incurring fees under specific conditions. This capability could potentially threaten the protocol's economic stability if a large number of users exploit this to claim `pTokens` without fees.

### Root Cause

#### Example Approach:
- **Initial Claim**: Begin by claiming a substantial amount of `pTokens` to establish a buffer.
- **Consistent Redemptions**: Regularly redeem `pTokens`, ensuring that claimed amounts always exceed redeemed amounts.

The outlined strategies leverage the intended functionality of the PointTokenVault contract. However, widespread adoption of these strategies by users could reduce the protocol's fee revenue, impacting its financial model and sustainability.

**Incentive Misalignment**: If users consistently avoid fees, it may reveal a misalignment between user incentives and the protocol's intended economic goals.

**Economic Vulnerability**: Such vulnerabilities occur when protocol design or incentives lead to unintended financial outcomes, such as diminished revenue or skewed incentives.

### Attack Path

### Potential Exploit Path:
#### Maximizing Feeless Redemptions:

1. **Claim vs. Redeem Strategy**: Ensure that the number of `pTokens` claimed is equal to or greater than those intended for redemption. This allows users to redeem up to the claimed amount without fees.
   
2. **Monitoring**: Keep track of the `claimedPTokens` and `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` mappings to determine the amount of `pTokens` that can be redeemed without fees.

3. **Feeless Redemption Limit**: Users can redeem `pTokens` without fees up to the difference between their total claimed and feelessly redeemed `pTokens`.

4. **Redemption Planning**: Strategically plan redemptions to remain within the feeless redemption limit.

5. **Fee and Protocol Updates**: Stay informed about any changes in mint and redemption fees or protocol updates that could affect feeless redemption strategies.

### Impact

**Impact**: The primary impact is financial, potentially affecting the protocol's sustainability, profitability, and overall economic model.

### Mitigation

### Considerations:

**Protocol Sustainability**: Continuously evaluate the economic model to ensure it aligns with user behavior and market conditions.

**Adaptive Design**: Incorporate mechanisms like dynamic fee structures or incentive adjustments to adapt to evolving user behavior.

**User Engagement**: Actively engage with users to understand their needs and behaviors, and adjust the protocol as necessary.

In conclusion, economic vulnerabilities, while distinct from security vulnerabilities, can result in financial loss. Significant financial impacts should be prioritized for resolution.
