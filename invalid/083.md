# Set both `MERKLE_UPDATER_ROLE` and `OPERATOR_ROLE` in the constructor

## Summary
both `MERKLE_UPDATER_ROLE` and `OPERATOR_ROLE` are not granted in the `PointTokenVault::initialize()` function, meaning that nobody will be able to use the restricted functionality
## Vulnerability Detail
If the roles aren't set in the `intialize()` function nobody will be able to call the fallowing list of functions:
`renouncePauseRole()`, `unpausePToken()`, `pausePToken()`, `setRedemptionFee()`, `setMintFee()`, `setRedemption()`, `setCap()`, `updateRoot()`

This breaks the whole functionality of the protocol, since some the functions like `setCap()` and `updateRoot()` are crucial for the functioning of the system
## Impact
Protocol will be practically unusable, since the operator and the markle updater won't be able to do their job

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add the  operator and the markle updater addresses as inputs in the `initialize()` function and grant them the roles using `_grantRole()` function.
