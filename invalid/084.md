# Fee-On-Transfer issus in both `deposit()` and `convertRewardsToPTokens()` functions

## Summary
Missing Fee-On-Transfer pattern in both functions.
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the protocol supports Fee-On-Transfer it will be a good idea to implement such patterns when transferring tokens from into the contract.
## Impact
absence of such patter leaves the contract with less funds than accounted.

## Recommendation
check the balance before and after the token transfers, subtract these numbers and account the difference to mitigate this issue.
