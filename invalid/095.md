# "setParam" Function Always Reverts Due to Mismatched bytes32 and String Literal Comparison

### Summary

The "setParam" function incorrectly compares a bytes32 parameter with string literals, leading to unintended reverts. This issue prevents the function from setting parameters correctly, resulting in the else statement always triggering the revert.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the direct comparison of bytes32 values with string literals. Since string literals are not directly comparable to bytes32, the comparisons always fail, causing the else block to execute and revert the transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

The setParam function accepts a bytes32 parameter 

### External pre-conditions

The contract is deployed and the "setParam" function is called externally

### Attack Path

An attacker could exploit this issue by deliberately passing a bytes32 value that does not match any of the intended comparisons, causing the function to revert and potentially disrupt the contractâ€™s functionality.

### Impact

The impact of this issue is that the "setParam" function fails to update any parameters as intended, and always reverts the transaction. This prevents the contract owner from configuring the contract's critical parameters, which could lead to a loss of functionality or the inability to upgrade or modify the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Hash using the keccak256 function to produce bytes32 values.
