# Operator can potentially permanently lock PTokens for all users

### Summary

Missing validations in the renouncePauseRole function can cause a permanent lock of PTokens for all users as an operator can accidentally renounce the PAUSE_ROLE while the PToken is paused.


### Root Cause

The choice to allow renouncing the PAUSE_ROLE without checks is a mistake as it can lead to an unrecoverable paused state for PTokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Operator needs to have OPERATOR_ROLE to call renouncePauseRole function
2. PToken needs to be in a paused state

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Operator calls pausePToken function to pause a specific PToken
2. Operator accidentally calls renouncePauseRole function for the same PToken
3. PointTokenVault loses PAUSE_ROLE for that PToken
4. PToken remains permanently paused with no way to unpause it

### Impact

The users cannot transfer, mint, or burn the affected PToken, effectively losing access to their assets in that PToken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a safeguard in the renouncePauseRole function to check if the PToken is currently paused before renouncing the role or have force flag turned on explicity if renouncing role on paused PToken.
