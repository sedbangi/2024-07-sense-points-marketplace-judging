# Lack of Modifier & Dust Amounts and DoS Risk in collectFees Function

### Summary

The collectFees function does not include a check to ensure that significant fees have been accumulated before collecting. This could lead to a scenario where an attacker repeatedly calls this function with very small amounts, resulting in unnecessary gas consumption and potentially causing the contract to run out of gas. The collectFees function can be called by any user, potentially leading to excessive gas usage if it is called repeatedly with dust amounts.


### PoC

``` solidity
// bug its better to have modifier to avoid every random user calling cause if a bad user keeps calling this func gas fees would be a lot and when the contract has not collected anything but some dust amounts calling it would make the contract out of gas and might cause unexpected situation
    function collectFees(bytes32 _pointsId) external {
        (uint256 pTokenFee, uint256 rewardTokenFee) = (pTokenFeeAcc[_pointsId], rewardTokenFeeAcc[_pointsId]);

        if (pTokenFee > 0) {
            pTokens[_pointsId].mint(feeCollector, pTokenFee);
            pTokenFeeAcc[_pointsId] = 0;
        }

        if (rewardTokenFee > 0) {
            // There will only be a positive rewardTokenFee if there are reward tokens in this contract available for transfer.
            redemptions[_pointsId].rewardToken.safeTransfer(feeCollector, rewardTokenFee);
            rewardTokenFeeAcc[_pointsId] = 0;
        }

        emit FeesCollected(_pointsId, feeCollector, pTokenFee, rewardTokenFee);
   
```

### Mitigation

Introduce a minimum fee threshold before allowing the collection of fees, or a modifier to limit how frequently this function can be called. ++ we can add a access control modifier as well =>modifier to restrict access or limit how frequently the function can be called.
