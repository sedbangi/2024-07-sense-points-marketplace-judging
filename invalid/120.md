# Malicious Actors can cause Grieving by Forcing Tokens into the Contract Leading to Cap Over-limit.

### Summary

The PointTokenVault.sol contract does not have internal accounting mechanisms to track the actual amount of tokens held within the contract. This oversight allows an attacker to exploit the lack of accounting checks by forcing tokens into the contract, resulting in a situation where the token balance exceeds the cap limit. The protocol does not currently have checks in place to prevent or mitigate this attack, leading to potential denial-of-service or operational disruptions.

### Root Cause

The PointTokenVault.sol contract relies solely on external transfers and approvals to manage its token balances and lacks internal accounting controls. When users deposit tokens, the contract correctly increments its internal balances, but there is no mechanism to detect or handle tokens transferred directly to the contract address outside of the usual deposit flow. For instance it uses the total token balance in the contract to check the cap limit is not violated.

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The PointTokenVault.sol contract has a set cap for the amount of each token it is designed to handle.
The contract does not have internal accounting mechanisms that actively monitor and validate the actual token balance against the cap.
Tokens can be sent directly to the contract address without calling a function in the PointTokenVault contract (i.e., through a standard ERC20 transfer).

### External pre-conditions

An attacker has tokens of the type managed by the PointTokenVault.
The contract must be deployed and active with a cap set for at least one of the supported tokens.
There is no restriction or filter on direct ERC20 token transfers to the PointTokenVault contract address.

### Attack Path

Attacker sends tokens directly to the PointTokenVault contract: The attacker uses an ERC20 transfer function to send tokens directly to the contract's address without interacting with the deposit function.
Exceeding the cap: The contract's token balance increases without any checks, potentially pushing the total amount over the pre-set cap.
Operational disruption: When the cap is exceeded, users may face issues with further deposits or withdrawals. The contract may malfunction due to incorrect internal balance assumptions.
Potential denial-of-service: If the contract logic or any external contracts interacting with it relies on the cap limit being respected, they may malfunction or be unable to interact correctly, resulting in a denial-of-service.

### Impact

Operational Disruption: The protocol may face operational issues due to incorrect balances, leading to failed transactions or incorrect logic execution.
Denial-of-Service: By exceeding the cap, the contract's logic may break or prevent legitimate user interactions, causing a denial-of-service.
Loss of Trust: Users and investors may lose trust in the protocol due to perceived mismanagement or vulnerability to attack.

    }
}

```

### Mitigation

Implement internal accounting mechanisms to track the token balance within the contract independently of the actual ERC20 token balance. Add an internal mapping to track the total balance of each token and modify the relevant functions to update this mapping instead of relying solely on the token's balance in the contract.

Add checks to the deposit and any other relevant functions to ensure that the total token balance does not exceed the predefined cap.

Implement logic to reject or handle tokens sent directly to the contract address outside of the typical deposit mechanism.

By applying these mitigations, the protocol can avoid potential griefing attacks that aim to disrupt operations or exceed predefined caps, thereby maintaining functional integrity and user trust.
