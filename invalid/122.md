# The protocol does not support fee-on tokens, which may result in users being able to withdraw more tokens

### Summary

[The documentation ](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/494)states that the protocol should support fee-on tokens.
However, it is not actually supported when [depositing and withdrawing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L114-L136), which will lead to incorrect fund recording and processing. All handling fees will be borne by the user who finally withdraws funds.

### Root Cause

In [the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/076bf833f4dc1418e93c8172e4a4110344f1c812/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L114-L136), the amount of deposit is recorded, and fee-on transfer is not considered.
