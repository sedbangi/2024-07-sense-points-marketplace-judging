# execute Function Can Freeze Tokens or Assets Due to Unchecked delegatecall Failure

### Summary

The execute function in the PointTokenVault contract is designed to handle arbitrary reward claiming logic using delegatecall. However, the function does not check the success of the delegatecall, potentially leading to a situation where tokens or assets become "frozen" within the contract if the delegatecall fails. This oversight can directly impact the protocol by locking users' assets, preventing them from being moved or accessed, and causing disruptions in protocol operations.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the lack of error handling in the execute function when performing a delegatecall. delegatecall executes code in the context of the calling contract (i.e., PointTokenVault), meaning any storage modifications will affect PointTokenVault directly. If the delegatecall fails (e.g., due to out-of-gas, reverting, or other errors), the lack of proper error handling means the contract will not revert or take corrective action, potentially leading to asset or token freezing.

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The execute function makes a low-level delegatecall without checking the returned status (success).
The _to address provided to execute can contain arbitrary code that might not handle the call properly or could revert.
The protocol relies on this function to interact with external reward mechanisms or token contracts.

### External pre-conditions

The function can only be called by an entity with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.
The admin provides a _to address and _data payload to execute, which could potentially fail or consume excessive gas.
The protocol or its users have funds or tokens stored within the PointTokenVault that are accessible via delegatecall.

### Attack Path

Admin calls the execute function on the PointTokenVault contract.
The execute function performs a delegatecall to the _to address with the provided _data and _txGas.
The _to address contains a function or code that reverts, fails, or exhausts the gas limit provided.
Due to the absence of a success check in execute, the contract does not revert, and tokens or assets within PointTokenVault associated with that operation remain in an unusable state.
These tokens or assets are effectively "frozen" because subsequent attempts to interact with them may fail due to the unhandled error state from the failed delegatecall.

### Impact

Freezing of Assets: Tokens or assets within the PointTokenVault may become inaccessible or frozen if the delegatecall fails without being checked or handled. This can prevent users from withdrawing or transferring their assets, causing inconvenience and potential financial loss.

Operational Disruption: The failure to handle errors properly in execute can lead to unintended behavior, disrupting normal operations of the protocol. Admin actions that rely on execute might unintentionally lock up assets, creating a cascading effect of failures or user dissatisfaction.

Trust and Reputation Damage: Users and stakeholders may lose trust in the protocol if they experience or hear about incidents where assets became frozen due to a lack of error handling in critical functions.

Financial Loss: While the assets may not be lost in the traditional sense, the inability to access or move them effectively equates to a financial loss, as users cannot utilize their funds as intended..

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent freezing of assets due to unchecked delegatecall failure, the execute function should explicitly handle the success or failure of the delegatecall. Additionally, restricting the execute function to authorized calls only and validating _to addresses and _data payloads can mitigate risks.

function execute(address _to, bytes memory _data, uint256 _txGas)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
        returns (bool)
    {
        (bool success, ) = _to.delegatecall{gas: _txGas}(_data);
        
        require(success, "delegatecall failed");

        return success;
    }
