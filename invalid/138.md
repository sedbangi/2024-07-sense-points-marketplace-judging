# Tokens with Fee on transfer are not supported

## Summary
Some fee on transfer tokens do not reduce the fee directly from the transferred amount,but subtracts it from the remaining balance of sender.Some tokens prefer this approach to make the amount received by the recipient an exact amount.Therefore after funds are send to users,balance becomes less than it should be.so this contract does not support fee on transfer tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
 function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }

        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }

    function withdraw(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        balances[msg.sender][_token] -= _amount;

        _token.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }

## Impact
user funds can get lost after transfer.
