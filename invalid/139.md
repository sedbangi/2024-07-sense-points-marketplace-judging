# Unbounded Loop in `initialize` Function May Lead to Denial of Service (DoS)

### Summary

The unbounded loop in the `initialize` function will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for users and admin as malicious actors can provide a large array of initialization calls (`initCalls`), leading to the loop consuming excessive gas and potentially exceeding the block gas limit, which would prevent the contract from executing critical functions during Safe setup.

### Root Cause

In the `initialize` function that is `external` in `InitializationScript.sol:26`, the unbounded loop lacks any restrictions on the maximum size of the `initCalls` array, allowing for potential exploitation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `createWallet` function in `RumpelWalletFactory.sol:43` is called to deploy a new Safe contract.
2. The `initialize` function is invoked as part of the Safe setup process.
3. A large `initCalls` array is passed to the `initialize` function during this process.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker can call the `createWallet` function to deploy a new Safe.
2. The attacker supplies a very large `initCalls` array when invoking `createWallet`.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a large `initCalls` array when calling `createWallet`.
2. The `createWallet` function deploys a new Safe and calls the `initialize` function in `InitializationScript.sol`.
3. The loop in `initialize` processes all items in the `initCalls` array.
4. Due to the large size of the array, the loop consumes a significant amount of gas.
5.If the gas consumption exceeds the block gas limit, the transaction fails.
6. This failure could prevent the proper initialization of the Safe, resulting in a DoS condition.

### Impact

The users and admin suffer an approximate loss of service availability. Critical initialization functions may fail to execute, leading to a Denial of Service for the contract, potentially blocking the deployment or proper functioning of Safes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a maximum length on the initCalls array, such as
```solidity
require(initCalls.length <= MAX_INIT_CALLS, "initCalls array too large");

```
where `MAX_INIT_CALLS` is a reasonable upper bound for the number of initialization calls.
