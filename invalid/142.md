# Attackers can cause DOS attacks for tokens with Cap

## Summary
Attackers can prevent users from depositing certain tokens into the protocol, causing DOS attacks for tokens with Cap

## Vulnerability Detail
Users are able to deposit tokens into the vault using the `deposit()` function, however, certain tokens have a deposit limit or `cap`:
```solidity
    function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
@>          if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }
         ...
    }
```
These tokens can also be withdrawn at any time through the `withdraw()` function with no regulation capabilities whatsoever:
```solidity
function withdraw(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        balances[msg.sender][_token] -= _amount;

        _token.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```
This allows attackers to run bots that monitor the deposit transactions to any of these capped tokens and front-run it to deposit the capped amount and then back-run it to withdraw out the amount, causing users' deposit transactions to those tokens to revert.
There are multiple reasons for attackers to perform such malicious attacks such as competitor advantage or blackhat reasons e.t.c
## Impact

## Recommendation
In order to prevent these attacks for tokens with caps, consider implementing a minimum cooldown on withdrawals and a regulating capability of penalizing such activities e.g slashing, temporary blocking or seizing of withdrawals for such blacklisted addresses.
