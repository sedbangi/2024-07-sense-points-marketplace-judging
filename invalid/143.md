# `PToken.sol` role access blocks usage of the contract `PToken.sol` and `PointTokenVault.sol`

### Summary

There is no admin role configuration, and since no account has received the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, no modifications could be done to the PAUSE_ROLE and SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE set on PToken constructor, meaning no new address or revoke to those addresses/roles, if in a case of wrongful revoke from PointTokenVault, the maintainers of the protocol cannot pause or stop the mint of PTokens since the role was revoked and there is no DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE address set.[](url)

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PToken.sol#L13-L20 there is no `_grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, {address})`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `OPERATOR_ROLE` calls https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L331-L333 and pause the PToken contract.
2. `OPERATOR_ROLE` calls https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L339-L341 and renounce the PAUSE_ROLE.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. No new PTokens can me mint or burnt from the PToken contract, allowing no new users to increase their points position into the protocol set on the `pointsId` of that PToken contract.
2. No new addresses can have any ROLE on the PToken contract since there is no `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

### Impact

- The `claimPTokens` function and the `redeemRewards` functions become useless since no new PTokens can be added or subtracted.
- No interactions can be made with the PToken contract, making it a soulbound ERC20 in the user's wallet.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a `_setRoleAdmin` for the `PAUSE_ROLE` and `SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE` as `SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE` since there is no revoke to the `SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE` available or give the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to an administrative secure wallet.

Such as:
```solidity
constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint8 _decimals, address _administrator)
        ERC20(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
        AccessControl()
    {
        _grantRole(PAUSE_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(SUPPLY_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _administrator);
    }
```
