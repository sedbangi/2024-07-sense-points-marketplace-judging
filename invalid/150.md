# PointTokenVault.sol#redeemRewards - Wrong calculations lead to more tokens being burnt

## Summary
User burns more tokens if he claims in portions, rather if they had claimed the full amount in a single transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users pass `_claim` struct to the `redeemRewards` function, and we will focus on the `totalClaimable`and `amountToClaim` variables. `totalClaimable` holds how much user can claim and `amountToClaim` holds how much will be claimed in the current transaction. `pTokens` are burned according to the calculated `pTokensToBurn` by dividing `amountToClaim` to `rewardsPerPToken`.
```js
        uint256 pTokensToBurn = FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken);
```

The problem occurs when a user attempts to claim rewards in portions rather than in a single transaction. Because the result is rounded up, claiming rewards in portions leads to the user burning more `pTokens` than if they had claimed the entire amount at once.

Let's look at the example:

Single claim on 100 tokens at once:
`pTokensToBurn = divWadUp(100, 3) = 33.33 which will round up to 34
`

10 claims x 10 tokens:
`
pTokensToBurn = divWadUp(10, 3) = 3.33 which will round up to 4, 10 claims * 4 = 40
`
As we can see, significantly more `pTokens` are burnt when the user redeems his tokens in multiple transactions, allowing the user to always redeem the maximum amount so that he has more `pTokens` left to redeem and claim more rewards.

Impact
 Wrong calculations lead to more tokens being burnt
