# fee-on-transfer tokens can break the withdraw

### Summary

The current implementation doesn't work with fee-on-transfer underlying tokens.

### Root Cause

```solidity 
function deposit(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        uint256 cap = caps[address(_token)];

        if (cap != type(uint256).max) {
            if (_amount + _token.balanceOf(address(this)) > cap) {
                revert DepositExceedsCap();
            }
        }

        _token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);

        balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```
as we can see when user try to deposit a fee-on-trnsfer token ,

his balance 
```solidity
balances[_receiver][_token] += _amount;
```
will updated with amount , however the vault will not get what the user had send but less.
```solidity
function withdraw(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) public {
        balances[msg.sender][_token] -= _amount;

        _token.safeTransfer(_receiver, _amount);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _receiver, address(_token), _amount);
    }
```
then when user try to withdraw will fail due to less balances in the vault. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1.bob deposit 100 token to the vault.
2.the token had fee of 2% 
3.bob balance new is 100 on the value but the amount in value is 98 (100+2% fee).
4.bob try to withdrew 100 but the function fail. 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will not receive the correct or fail to get amount when withdrawing.

### Mitigation

Check balance before and after transferring, then update user balance.
