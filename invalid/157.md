# Blocked function selectors can never be unblocked

### Summary

If a default function selector, such as `Transfer`, is blocked on the `RumpelModule`, it can never be unblocked, therefore making the major part of a wallets executions not utilized.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/rumpel-wallet/src/RumpelModule.sol#L69-L72

### Root Cause

In `RumpelModule.sol` there is no `removeBlockedModuleCall` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner call the `addBlockedModuleCall` function with the params of `0xa9059cbb ` on `bytes4 functionSelector`.

### External pre-conditions

1. The user has reward token balance on the rumpel wallet bigger than zero.

### Attack Path

1. User gets a reward estimated on 1 eth aprox.
2. Owner make the transfer unavailable as for the moment, as showed on Internal pre-conditions.
3. Try to move and/or swap the tokens and the execution gets blocked.
4. The funds get stuck on the rumpel wallet since the execution of the function selector cannot be unblocked.

### Impact

The user/protocol suffers from stuck funds that can never be moved.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `removeBlockedModuleCall` on rumpel module.

```solidity
    function removeBlockedModuleCall(address target, bytes4 functionSelector) external onlyOwner {
        blockedModuleCalls[target][functionSelector] = false;
        emit SetModuleCallUnblocked(target, functionSelector);
    }
```
