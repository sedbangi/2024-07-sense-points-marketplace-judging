# Incorrect logic allows expired Merkle roots to be accepted during proof verification

### Summary

The incorrect comparison logic in proof verification will cause acceptance of expired Merkle roots for users as the contract mistakenly allows proofs based on the previous root instead of rejecting them.

### Root Cause

In [PointTokenVault.sol:282-284](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-sense-points-marketplace/blob/main/point-tokenization-vault/contracts/PointTokenVault.sol#L282-L284), the candidateRoot is compared against both the currRoot and prevRoot using != conditions. This logic flaw allows expired proofs to be incorrectly validated against the prevRoot when it should have triggered an error for being expired.

### Internal pre-conditions

A previous Merkle root (prevRoot) has been replaced with a new current root (currRoot).
A user submits a proof based on the expired prevRoot.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user submits a claim with a proof that was valid under the previous Merkle root (prevRoot).
2. The contract incorrectly allows the proof to pass verification since the logic accepts both the current and previous roots.
3. The proof is accepted despite being based on an expired root, leading to invalid claims being processed.

### Impact

Users may be able to submit expired proofs, potentially leading to unauthorized claims or double claiming under the new and previous Merkle roots. This could lead to inconsistencies in reward distribution and potential loss or unfair advantage.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
if (candidateRoot != currRoot || candidateRoot == prevRoot) {
    revert ProofInvalidOrExpired();
}
```
