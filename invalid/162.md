**Description**

Solidity versions 0.8.13 and 0.8.14 are vulnerable to a reported [optimizer bug](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug/) related to inline assembly. Solidity 0.8.15 has been released with a fix.

PointTokenVault.sol inherits solidity contracts from solmate FixedPointMathLib,it uses inline assembly, and optimization is enabled while compiling.

**Impact**
This bug only occurs under very specific conditions: the legacy optimizer must be enabled rather than the IR pipeline (true for the current project configuration), and the affected assembly blocks must not refer to any local Solidity variables.

**Tools Used**

Manual Review

**Recommended mitigation**

Use recent Solidity version 0.8.15 which has the fix for these issues.
