# Incorrect balance calculation for the `fee-on-transfer` tokens in the `PointTokenVault`.

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens will not be calculated properly for balance of the user if deposited using `PointVaultToken::deposit()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
AS the protocol allows the fee-on-transfer.
```solidity
1. If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of weird tokens you want to integrate?

Yes, whitelisted tokens only. They're assumed to not be reentrant, but fee-on-transfer, pausable, and blocklist tokens are OK.
```
It will use the same deposit function to deposit the token.
So For eg:-
- If Alice deposit 20 fee-on-transfer token using the `PointVaultToken::deposit()`.
- Now according the `PointVaultToken::deposit()` function it will use `safeTransferFrom()` function to transfer the amount passed as the parameter in which  user has defined amount = 20 tokens .
- Now if we assume the total fees for transferring 20 token is 2 tokens so the `PointVaultToken` will receive only 18 tokens .
- But It will upate the balance of the receiver with the amount which user has passed in the function parameter which is 20 token.
- In this way the Vault contract will update wrong balance for the user.

## Impact
User balance will be updated as more than the actual balance of what he deposited.

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
Maybe try implementing different function for the fee-on-transfer tokens.
