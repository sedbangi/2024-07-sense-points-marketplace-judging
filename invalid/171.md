# Critical Exploit in `claimPTokens` Function Allows Unauthorized Token Claims via Misuse of `trustedClaimers`

## Summary
The `PointTokenVault.sol` contract contains a critical vulnerability in its `claimPTokens` function, where any user can set other accounts as a trusted claimer if the account has claimable tokens and then proceed to steal that account's claimable tokens. This occurs because the contract allows any receiver to add any account as their `trustedClaimers` without sufficient validation. This flaw can lead to significant losses for users whose claimable tokens are at risk of being stolen by malicious actors.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `claimPTokens` function permits any `msg.sender` to mint tokens to `receiver` as long as the `_account` is listed as one of the receiver's `trustedClaimers`. However, since the `trustClaimer` function can be called by any receiver to add any `_account` as their `trustedClaimers`, a malicious receiver can exploit this by setting those accounts with claimable tokens as a `trustedClaimer`. Once such `_account` with claimable tokens is listed as a `trustedClaimer`, receiver or msg.sender can then mint tokens based on the `_account`'s claimable amount, effectively stealing the tokens.
The absence of a proper verification process in the `claimPTokens` function to ensure that the `msg.sender` is either the `_account` itself or a legitimately authorized claimer.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to steal tokens from any account that has claimable tokens, as long as they can set those accounts as `trustedClaimer`. This can lead to significant financial loss and a breach of trust in the system, ultimately undermining the security and integrity of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This could involve verifying the relationship between `msg.sender` and `_account` to prevent unauthorized claims. Implement stricter controls on who can add `trustedClaimer`, potentially requiring multi-signature approvals or additional verification steps to prevent malicious actors from exploiting this function.
