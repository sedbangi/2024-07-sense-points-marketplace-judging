# `claimedPTokens` is accounted for incorrectly

## Summary

In the `redeemRewards()` function, some fees are deducted from the excess amount of `pToken`s that exceed the user's claimed `pToken` amount. This means that if a user redeems rewards by burning `pToken`s greater than what they have claimed, they should incur a fee. The limit for which no fee is deducted is `claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]`, but this is incorrect, as the actual amount of `pToken`s claimed by the user is less than `claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]` due to fees already being deducted when claiming `pToken`s.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario.

**Assume:** `mintFee = 0.1e18` and `redemptionFee = 0.1e18` (10%).

1. Alice calls the `claimPTokens()` function to claim 10 `pToken`s.
2. The `_verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed()` function is invoked (line 159) to update `claimedPTokens`.

    - `claimedPTokens[Alice][pointsId] = 10` (line 294).
3. `pTokenFee = 1` (line 156, as `mintFee = 0.1e18`).
4. Alice receives 9 `pToken`s (line 159).

    ```solidity
        function claimPTokens(Claim calldata _claim, address _account, address _receiver) public {
            ...

    146     _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(_claim, claimHash, _account, claimedPTokens);

            ...

    156     uint256 pTokenFee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(_claim.amountToClaim, mintFee);
            pTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += pTokenFee;

    159     pTokens[pointsId].mint(_receiver, _claim.amountToClaim - pTokenFee); // Subtract mint fee.

            ...
        }

    ----------------------

        function _verifyClaimAndUpdateClaimed(
            ...
    294         _claimed[_account][pointsId] = alreadyClaimed + amountToClaim;
    ```

5. Alice gets an additional 1 `pToken`.

    - Alice now has 10 `pToken`s.
6. Alice calls the `redeemRewards()` function to receive rewards by burning her 10 `pToken`s.

    - `feelesslyRedeemable = 10` (line 198).
    - This leads to the case in line 203, where no fee is applied.

    ```solidity
        function redeemRewards(Claim calldata _claim, address _receiver) public {
            ...

    194     uint256 claimed = claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];
            uint256 feelesslyRedeemed = feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];

            
    198     uint256 feelesslyRedeemable = claimed - feelesslyRedeemed;

            ...
                
    203     if (feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn) {
                // If all of the pTokens are free to redeem without fee.
                rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim;
                feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += pTokensToBurn;
            } else {
                ...
    ```

In summary, Alice receives 9 `pToken`s through claiming and 1 pToken not through claiming. When redeeming rewards by burning all her 10 `pToken`s, she incurs no fee, even though the additional `pToken` was not obtained through a claim. This issue arises because `claimedPTokens` is not updated based on the actual minted `pToken` amount that Alice received during the claiming process (step 2).

## Impact

The protocol incurs a loss of fees.

## Recommendation

`claimedPTokens` should be updated based on the actual minted `pToken` amount received by users.
