# Users will have to pay extra fees due to wrong calculation of redemptionÂ fees

## Summary
Users have to pay unnecessary fees amount due to the incorrect logic for calculating the redemptionFees in `redeemRewards()`

## Vulnerability Detail

Lets take a condition where all the claimed pTokens has been reedemed for rewards and the account now tries to redeem for the extraPtokens gained from the other transactions.

That means now users has to pay the fees for the entire `amountToClaim`


Now we see the function `redeemRewards()`.

`pTokensToBurn` is calculated using roundingUp the (`amountToClaim * rewardsPerPToken)` using the lib function `divWadUp`.

Also , `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` = 0 , since `claimed` = `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId]`. 

now the function pointer goes inside the else condition where feelesslyRedeemable  < pTokensToBurn.

Fee is then caculated by multiplying redeemableWithFee and rewardsPerPToken to get the amount  , where  redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn * feelesslyRedeemable.

since pTokensToBurn is rounded Up , pTokensToBurn * feelesslyRedeemable can be greater than amountToClaim.


So instead they should have mentioned amountToClaim which is real amount  that user needs get reward For .



```solidity
    function redeemRewards(Claim calldata _claim, address _receiver) public {
     .....

        uint256 pTokensToBurn = FixedPointMathLib.divWadUp(amountToClaim, rewardsPerPToken);
        pTokens[pointsId].burn(msg.sender, pTokensToBurn);

        uint256 claimed = claimedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];
        uint256 feelesslyRedeemed = feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId];

        // The amount of pTokens that are free to redeem without fee.
        uint256 feelesslyRedeemable = claimed - feelesslyRedeemed;

        uint256 rewardsToTransfer;
        uint256 fee;

        if (feelesslyRedeemable >= pTokensToBurn) {
            // If all of the pTokens are free to redeem without fee.
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim;
            feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] += pTokensToBurn;
        } else {
            // If some or all of the pTokens need to be charged a fee.
            uint256 redeemableWithFee = pTokensToBurn - feelesslyRedeemable;
            // fee = amount of pTokens that are not feeless * rewardsPerPToken * redemptionFee
 >          fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
                FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(redeemableWithFee, rewardsPerPToken), redemptionFee
            );
            rewardTokenFeeAcc[pointsId] += fee;
            rewardsToTransfer = amountToClaim - fee;


            if (feelesslyRedeemed != claimed) {
                feelesslyRedeemedPTokens[msg.sender][pointsId] = claimed;
            }
        }


        params.rewardToken.safeTransfer(_receiver, rewardsToTransfer);

        emit RewardsClaimed(msg.sender, _receiver, pointsId, rewardsToTransfer, fee);
    }
```

This issue will occur even when `feelesslyRedeemedPTokens` != 0 but has the extra pTokens that are not claimed but needs to be redeemed for rewards.


## Impact
Users have to pay unnecessary fees amount due to the incorrect logic for calculating the redemptionFees in `redeemRewards()`

## Recommendation

correct calculation 
fee = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(
    (amountClaim - (feelesslyRedeemable*rewardsPerPToken) )
               , redemptionFee
            );
